  <p>The apartment in which I stayed during my time in Osaka was in Naniwa-ku,
  however just a 15 minute walk east, just a little past the iconic
  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ts%C5%ABtenkaku"><ruby>通天閣<rt>つうてんかく</rt></ruby> (Tsutenkaku)</a>,
  puts you in the <ruby>天王子<rt>てんおうじ</rt></ruby> (Tennōji) ward.</p>

  <p>My first outing once arriving in Osaka was to visit the Tennōji Zoo,
  specifically to witness my favourite animal of all, the Red Panda, in real
  life. Afterwards, I made a mental note to revisit the surrounding park, as it
  seemed quite nice&hellip; Now, three days pending my departure home, I
  finally remembered to return just to wander with a camera.</p>

  <p>Tennōji Park is as so many Japanese attractions are: calm, beautiful, and
  clean. The bridge was a pleasant surprise to stumble upon; its brilliant red
  coat constrasting so well against the green and blue that surround it.
  Benches line the walkway overlooking the pond, and if one lived nearby and
  ever needed to relax for a while, I could not imagine a more perfect
  place to do so.</p>
