  <p>My outing today was to <ruby>今宮戎<rt>いまみやえびす</rt></ruby><ruby>神社<rt>じんじゃ</rt></ruby>
  (Imamiyaebisu Shrine). This was my first time visiting a Shrine in Japan, and
  it happened to be the one that I can see from the window of my apartment. It's
  amazing to me how the density of Japanese cities results in such beautiful,
  old-style architecture nestled amongst the towering, modern cityscape.</p>

  <p>Imamiyaebisu is the shrine of Ebessan, god of business. Every year the
  "<ruby>十日戎<rt>とおかえびす</rt></ruby>" festival (literally, "10th day Ebisu", being on the 10th of January) takes
  place at this shrine. According to <a href="http://www.osaka-info.jp/en/facilities/cat21/post_301.html">Osaka Visitors' Guide</a>:</p>
  <blockquote>
    During the Toka Ebisu Festival, people buy sacred bamboo branches decorated
    with lucky items in hopes for the success of their businesses.
  </blockquote>

  <p>The atmosphere in this sacred garden was shocking. The bustle of the
  surrounding city melts away, and the heavy spiritual presence envelopes you
  &mdash; magnified by the other visitors, heads bowed in prayer, clapping twice
  to greet the diety. You immediately feel calm, humble, and at peace.</p>

  <p>I will absolutely be seeking out more shrines and temples during my stay here.</p>
