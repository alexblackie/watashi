  <p>My tourist efforts continue, today with Umeda Sky Building: an impressive
  business tower with rentable meeting rooms and offices, and the iconic
  "Floating Garden Observatory".</p>

  <p>The legitimate use of this building results in a somewhat amusing mix of
  lost tourists and groups of business men in suits mingling about the grounds.
  I can't imagine having to work or meet here and having to circumnavigate the
  hoardes of slow, inappropriately-dressed American tourists.</p>

  <p>While not as moving as <a href="/albums/9795e8fd-8aff-431e-a890-a054559feb8e/dd156508-fc4d-492e-a7b9-b5bcf32aad95">my first trip to a shrine</a>,
  I will never say no to a chance to be up high. The view, while partially
  obscured by clouds and/or smog, was magnificent.</p>
