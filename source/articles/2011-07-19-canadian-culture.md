title: Canadian Culture

excerpt: I am a Canadian. That means I have to put up with the monstrosity that is the CRTC (the regulating body for TV, Radio, and Internet in Canada). We are burdened with a government in Canada that wants to monitor and control everything we do on the Internet. Sounds a lot like the Communist Party of China, does it not?

For a supposedly “free country”, Canada seems to be turning against its citizens. The CRTC is behind our peril. Their passé goal of “preserving Canadian culture” is absolutely unnecessary in the technology age. The CRTC is trying to keep up, but all they’re doing is trying to regulate and control something they have no clue how to use. I bet you most of the CRTC board members don’t even have internet in their homes; if they do, it’s probably a 56K modem hooked up to their Compaq Deskpro so they can check their email in Eudora.

**The fact is: if something is of crappy quality, being Canadian doesn’t make it any better**. People still won’t listen to or watch something of low quality, regardless of its origin. Where it came from, or who made it is completely irrelevant. Just because something’s Canadian doesn’t mean it has to be shoved down our throats. With the global community that is the internet, there isn’t a need to “preserve culture”; the internet is its own culture.

Canadian literary authors are successful and well-respected in their field, and they are not regulated by a governing body. Music and television, however, are regulated, and rarely produce anything of significant quality; or the vast majority of Canadian talent ends up in the United States anyway. The simple truth is, talent is not constrained by geographical boundaries.

Almost every person in Canada has an internet connection. This means if they want to find Canadian content, they can go to [a](http://google.ca/) [search](http://yahoo.ca/) [engine](http://bing.com/) and search for “Canada”. I get about 3 billion results, and guess what? The CRTC didn’t have anything to do with my finding of Canadian content. If anything, their ridiculously broken laws on net neutrality are hindering my finding of this content.

So, **admit your defeat, CRTC**. If you stepped out of your fantasy world and opened your eyes, you’d see Canadians sharing and creating Canadian content without your help. Yes, that’s right, **you are not needed anymore**.

Step down, give up, say goodbye, and just let us use the tool you’re failing to understand. If you can’t keep up, you’re useless to us. Dismantling yourself would help Canadian culture, and wasn’t that your goal in the first place?
