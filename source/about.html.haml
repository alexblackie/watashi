          Developer at [Metalab][ml] by day, grade 12 student also by day&hellip;
          Sometimes I play drums, and sometimes I manage servers. Generally, I can
          be found behind glowing liquid crystals most hours of the day.

        At the ripe old age of nine, I discovered a book gathering dust in my
        parents&rsquo; closet: &ldquo;[HTML Complete][htmlcomplete]&rdquo;. It
        was this 1028-page book that started what would dictate the next
        several years of my life. It started with my super-secret spy company
        intranet, now to amazing projects at [Metalab][mlwork]. I have been
        writing code around eight years now.

        This is my blog. It is powered by [Middleman][mm], [Susy][susy], and
        [Amazon Cloudfront][cf]. The deployment is done automatically every
        time I push to `master` (all thanks to [Jenkins][jci]). Static HTML
        gives me the speed and ease-of-hosting that I desire, with the
        flexibility to do pretty much anything (and in any markup language I
        want).

        Deployment is handled by the awesome [middleman-sync][mmsync] gem,
        which simplifies deployment to a single command: `middleman sync`. That
        pushes the build to S3, which is them distributed across the globe via
        Cloudfront.

        Everything is available to everyone. Feel free to poke around the
        [Github repo][gh].
