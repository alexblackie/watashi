<a class="scrollAnchor" name="intro"></a>
<p>
	For many years now, Lenovo Thinkpads have been a mainstay in my life; their
	no-nonsense, practical offering greatly appealed to what I wanted in a
	machine. Its shortcomings in weight, thickness, and aesthetic were all areas
	I was more than happy to trade for superb battery life, port abundance, and
	"in the field" features like Power Bridge Batteries.
</p>

<p>
	However, Lenovo has been slowly turning Thinkpads into mainstream consumer
	trash. I found myself in want of a new laptop recently and found the entirety
	of the modern Thinkpad lineup revolting. The X280 is a disgrace to its
	namesake, the X1 Carbon makes way too many vain compromises for its thin
	profile, and everything else was either too big or too absurd for my needs
	(eg., the P71 fits both of those descriptors). I found myself at a loss,
	unsure of where to turn now that my beloved Thinkpads were spoiled by
	marketing and consumer trends.
</p>

<p>
	Recently I have been watching (all to frequently, but that is besides the
	point) Stargate Atlantis, and being the type of person I am took note
	immediately of their excellent use of various "rugged" or "Toughbook-style"
	laptops. Appropriate for toting off-world! This reminded me of the "rugged"
	laptop category, and thus began my research: could I find a small and
	relatively portable rugged laptop for a reasonable price?
</p>

<p>
	The answer is no.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="landscape"></a>
<h2>The Rugged Landscape</h2>

<p>
	I started my journey with the classic <strong>Panasonic Toughbook</strong>
	line, but immediately discovered they look like children's toy computers from
	2006. I'm not one to quibble over aesthetics but I found the Panasonic
	Toughbook series just simply repulsive. Not to mention the fact they would
	have set me back upwards of \$5000 CAD, which I was absolutely not comfortable
	with committing for this little experiment.
</p>

<p>
	I started digging a bit more and discovered what could be my new favourite
	company: <a href="http://en.getac.com/notebooks/index.html">Getac</a>. I
	immediately was drawn to their absurd "rugged laptop + a 1U server bolted to
	the bottom" product, and knew I was going in the right direction.
	Unfortunately, while the V110 looked like exactly what I was after, it's
	nearly impossible to find through normal channels in Canada. I did contact a
	local distributor for a quote but never followed up, as, while not as bad as
	a Toughbook, I was over-reaching my budget fairly handsomely.
</p>

<p>
	And then I found it: <a href="http://www.dell.com/en-ca/work/shop/laptops-ultrabooks/latitude-12-rugged-extreme-convertible-laptop/spd/latitude-12-7214-2-in-1-laptop/xctol721412usca">The Dell Latitude 12 "Rugged Extreme" (7214)</a>.
	I dug up some photos and reviews from around the web, and every part of this
	laptop spoke to me. The design is on-point, the featureset is plentiful, the
	chipset is modern, it's highly configurable... Except it <em>starts</em> at
	~\$6200 CAD.
</p>

<p>
	At this point, I was about to give up. It was a fun idea, but these prices
	are just too high for an individual like me to justify, at least for the time
	being. I'm not going to drop upwards of \$6k on a laptop I might not even
	like, and can't find more than a couple reviews of.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="ebay"></a>
<h2>Voyage to the Electronic Bay</h2>

<p>
	I have perused eBay many times in the past, but never built up enough courage
	(or money) to follow through and purchase something. I ended up on the site
	through a web search while researching the Dell 7214, and said, "oh, well of
	course!"
</p>

<p>
	Rugged laptops aren't popular in the mass market, for whatever reason.
	They're usually purchased by large organizations for short-term projects, and
	then liquidated at the end to refurbishing centres or what-have-you. This
	means you can find them on-line for <em>steep</em> discounts.
</p>

<p>
	The machine I'm typing this on now has an Intel Core i7-6600U, 32GB RAM, and
	a 256GB M.2 (SATA) SSD. After shipping, USD &rarr; CAD conversion, taxes, and
	import fees: a hair over $1500. Well under what I was expecting to pay for an
	X1 Carbon, and with a whole hell of a lot more horsepower and ports. It's
	perhaps worth noting I replicated my configuration on Dell's website and it
	totalled a little north of $10k CAD. Ouch.
</p>

<p>
	Unfortunately, eBay.
</p>

<p>
	It took a full 8 business days to get from Michigan to Qu√©bec, travelling in
	a circle more than once on its way here, and taking a nice 3-day rest in the
	receiving dock of the customs brokerage. It was one of the most frustrating
	package tracking experiences I've had, and until I got the "out for delivery"
	notification I was starting to wonder if I'd ever see it.
</p>

<p>
	Once it did arrive, however, I was ecstatic.
</p>

</figure>

<p>
Just how "rugged" is this machine? According to <a href="http://i.dell.com/sites/doccontent/shared-content/data-sheets/en/Documents/dell_latitude_12_rugged_extreme_spec_sheet.pdf">the whitepaper [PDF]</a>,
it conforms to the "MIL-STD-810G" testing specifications, which are:
</p>

<blockquote>
	Transit drop (72",60",48"; single unit; 78 drops), operating drop (36"),
	blowing rain, blowing dust, blowing sand, vibration, functional shock,
	humidity, salt fog (with rubberized keyboard), altitude, explosive
	atmosphere, solar radiation, thermal extremes, thermal shock, freeze/thaw,
	tactical standby to operational
</blockquote>

<p>
	Additionally,
</p>

<ul>
	<li>IP65 rating for particulates and liquid</li>
	<li>Fully operational between -29&deg;C and 63&deg;C</li>
	<li>MIL-STD-461F electromagnetic interference certification (I didn't bother looking this one up)</li>
</ul>

<p>
	... and a bunch more. You hopefully get the idea. I can't forsee myself ever
	being in a situation remotely close to any of these limits, but it's good to
	know I can work outside or in the rain without panicking or damaging
	something.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="bad"></a>
<h2>The Bad</h2>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="weight" data-parent="bad"></a>
<h3>Weight</h3>

<p>
	Make no mistake, this is a <strong>heavy</strong> laptop. All of these extra
	materials, mechanisms, and flourishes that make it "rugged" all also add
	weight. It clocks in at around 3kg, which is heavier than my 14" Thinkpad
	T460p and its extra-large battery by about 400g or-so.
</p>

<p>
	Mine does have the carry-handle addon, which makes it very easy to carry
	around wherever I need to go, but put it in a messenger bag and you're
	shoulder might start to ache. It's certainly not the <em>heaviest</em> laptop
	I've seen, but it's also certainly not lightweight.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="display" data-parent="bad"></a>
<h3>The Display</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/screen.jpg" alt="The screen in profile" width="960" height="380">
</figure>

<p>
	This machine doesn't have extensive screen options. No matter what, you get a
	11.6" 1366x768 TN panel with an anti-glare coating and resistive touchscreen.
</p>

<p>
	I don't mind the resolution <em>too much</em> at this size; I think 11.6" is
	small enough that such a measly resolution isn't out-of-place. That said,
	something <em>slightly</em> higher (like 1600x900), or even just an IPS-type
	panel would be a very welcome change.
</p>

<p>
	The anti-glare coating works quite well; Dell describe it as an
	"outdoor-viewable" screen, and I would have to agree. The coating mixed with
	the insanely bright backlight (I currently am working indoors and have it at
	about 20%, and it's as bright as my System76 Galago at 100%) make for a
	screen that truly "works anywhere". However the polarization and resistive
	layer do add a bit of a "depth" effect where it looks like there's a bit of
	space between my fingerprints and the screen below.
</p>

<p>
	The touchscreen is medicore as well. I mentioned it's resistive, which means
	it works based on pressure, so you can use it in the rain and/or with a stick
	you found in the woods and it'll work perfectly fine. It does mean, however,
	that it has that "old school" touchscreen behaviour where touches take a bit
	longer to register, aren't particularly accurate with a finger, and don't
	always work if you're used to capacitive screens and just caress the surface
	with your fingertip.
</p>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/testufo.jpg" alt="Photo of testufo.com test result" width="960" height="380">
</figure>

<p>
	One thing I have noticed is serious ghosting issues. I've tried to capture it
	in the above photo with the <a href="https://testufo.com/">testufo.com</a>
	tests. It's not entirely noticable in general use, but now and then you can
	catch it while scrolling web page with large text, or quickly-moving objects.
	For what I do, which mostly involves static screens full of text, it's rarely
	a noticeable issue.
</p>

<p>
	With all that said, I still give the screen a "pass". It's not unusable by
	any stretch of the imagination, it's just not <em>great</em>. We've been
	spoiled in the last few years by HiDPI screens and incredibly responsive
	capacitive touchscreens that using this one feels like a step into the recent
	past. But given some time to adjust, you can learn its idiosyncracies and
	it's just fine.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="touchpad" data-parent="bad"></a>
<h3>Touchpad</h3>

<p>
	I will not weasel my way around the trackpad &mdash; <strong>it's
	  bad.</strong> So bad that I avoid using if I can and move to the
	touchscreen. It's also resistive, like the touchscreen, which means you kind
	of need to press your fingers into it for it to activate. Once you do, you'll
	notice it's fairly small and pretty inaccurate.
</p>

<p>
	Small, inaccurate, hard to activate, and just overall unpleasant. It's
	probably the biggest downside I've experienced so far with this machine. I'm
	very glad the touchscreen is reasonable enough to make up for it.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="handle" data-parent="bad"></a>
<h3>The Handle</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/handle.jpg" alt="Top-down shot of the handle" width="960" height="270">
</figure>

<p>
	If the sheer thickness of the laptop doesn't catch your eye, it's chunky
	built-in handle certainly will.
</p>

<p>
	The handle sticks out the front, and is slightly higher than the keyboard
	deck. This means if the surface you're using is slightly too high, the handle
	will press into your arms. It's a nice, rubberized coating so it doesn't hurt
	or anything like that, but it is kind of annoying.
</p>

<p>
	But surely you can remove the handle, right? Right! Well&hellip; The handle
	acts as a giant antenna for all (four?) of the radios in this machine. That
	means while it looks like you can just unscrew it and take it off, in fact
	you have to entirely disassemble the laptop to disconenct all the antenna
	leads.
</p>

<p>
	Not only that, but then once you remove the handle, there will be exposed
	electronics on the exterior of the laptop, as you can't just buy more rubber
	nubs for the corners to replace where the handle was mounted.
</p>

<p>
	So without purchasing a <em>second</em> one of these to scavenge parts off
	of, removing the handle is not really an option; and even if I did have the
	replacement nubs, the amount of time and work involved might not even be
	worth it.
</p>

<p>
	All that said, the handle is actually really convenient for carrying the
	machine around. The rugged exterior does mean that you can take it to a
	coffeeshop without a sleeve, just carrying it by the handle. But it would be
	nice if I could more easily disconnect it for when it's just sitting on a
	desk.
</p>

<h2>The Good</h2>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="performance" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Performance</h3>

<p>
	Often "rugged"-style machines sacrifice performance because of thermal or
	power limitations -- this is not the case at all here.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>The CPU</strong> is an Intel¬Æ Core‚Ñ¢ i7-6600U @ 2.6GHz and with 4KB of
	L3 cache. Even though it's only a U-class CPU, so far the performance has
	been quite impressive, and is more than enough for everything I need to do.
	For some sort of benchmark, I had it calculate all prime numbers up to
	100,000 using all 4 of its threads:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">sysbench cpu --cpu-max-prime=100000 run --threads=4</div>

	<strong>The disk</strong> is an M.2 SATA SSD. The specific disk I have is a
	256GB Sandisk X400. It's an entirely average, consumer-grade SSD from what I
	can measure. A quick <code>fio</code> benchmark shows mediocre performance:
</p>

<p>
	Yikes. Fow now it'll do fine (especially with NAND prices where they
	currently are), but in the future I will likely swap this out for something a
	little higher-end.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>The RAM</strong> is 32GB DDR4 in dual-channel. The sticks I got
	appear to be Samsung OEM modules at 2133MT/s. This is my first non-server
	machine to have &gt;16GB RAM and I'm still unsure what to even do with all of
	it (oh wait, I just opened Slack; never mind: it's all used).
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="keyboard" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Keyboard</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/keyboard.jpg" alt="Dell 7214 Keyboard with blue backlight" width="960" height="261">
</figure>

<p>
	I was somewhat concerned about the keyboard before using it. Would it be made
	mushy and unpleasant in the name of "ruggedness"? No reviews I could find
	mentioned anything about it, so it was a bit of a gamble. Luckily, all my
	worrying was once again proved unfounded; this keyboard is
	<em>excellent</em>.
</p>

<p>
	It definitely feels different that any other laptop keyboard I've used. You
	can almost hear the rubber protection underneath when typing, but somehow the
	keys maintain a wonderfully crisp and responsive bump, landing in the soft
	embrace of the aforementioned rubber. This makes for a near-silent keypress,
	leaving only the noise of the bounce-back of the spacebar audible.
</p>

<p>
	The key size is slightly smaller than on my other, larger laptops, but I find
	my typing is just as accurate and quick as any other keyboard (perhaps even
	moreso).
</p>

<p>
	Overall, I find typing on this keyboard very enjoyable, easily equal to the
	experience of a Thinkpad or Topre external keyboard. Dell did an excellent
	job keeping it pleasant while also making it "rugged".
</p>

<p>
	This of course is all overshadowed by the fact it has RGB backlighting. It
	can cycle between green, blue, whiteish, and red with a Fn key combination
	("whiteish" as it has the classic RGB LED problem where it looks more like a
	light purple).
</p>

<p>
	The BIOS provides customization for the backlighting, including providing
	custom RGB values for 2 user presets, and changing the default backlight
	colour on boot. I didn't really bother to set my own custom colours, but did
	change the default to red, as it is the least jarring in the dark (the only
	situation in which I use backlighting).
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="thermals" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Thermals</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/load-test.png" alt="htop showing load" width="960" height="200">
</figure>

<p>
	I'm not usually impressed by laptop thermal solutions because usually they're
	"adequate". It's a fan, it spins, and when you push the CPU it gets audible.
	This is not the case with this laptop, however.
</p>

<p>
	I noticed on the bottom of the laptop there is a small vent with a reasonably
	small laptop fan behind it. I also noticed that while the computer was on,
	this fan was standing still. So I fired up <code>stress-ng</code> to put some
	load on the CPU (100% load on all cores, to be exact). The experiment went
	something like this&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	I'm sitting in a large room with an ambient temperature of around 24&deg;C.
	At idle, the CPU sits around 40&deg;C with the fan entirely off. Under 100%
	load on all cores, the CPU temperature slowly climbs over the course of about
	three minutes to 82&deg;C and holds &mdash; the passive cooling manages to
	keep the CPU under its 100&deg;C limit. After four minutes, the fan finally
	kicks in to ~3100RPM and the temperature rapidly drops and holds around
	67&deg;C.
</p>

<p>
	I ran the stress test for several minutes and at no point did the top part of
	the laptop deck get warm, and only for the last few minutes did the fan even
	spin. Dell calls their thermal solution "QuadCool&trade;", but never explains
	what that means; all I know is&mdash;whatever the magic is&mdash;it works
	really damn well.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="battery" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Battery and Power</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/battery.png" alt="Screenshot of GNOME Power settings" width="960" height="151">
</figure>

<p>
	Another strong point of this machine is its battery. 56Wh is not a large
	capacity, but it's removable and replacements are easy to purchase, so you
	can carry an extra in your backpack while travelling. In my experience, doing
	"light" tasks like work over SSH, screen at half brightness, and a bit of web
	browsing, I can expect around <strong>8 hours</strong> per battery. If you
	kill the brightness, keyboard backlight, and radios, you could probably
	manage to squeeze a couple more hours out of it.
</p>

<p>
	With two batteries, that means you can get 14 hours of medium-light usage
	without even trying (and assuming shutting down to swap the batteries is
	acceptable). This rivals even my old X250, which had much worse performance.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="tablet" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Convertible/Tablet mode</h3>

<figure>
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/tablet.jpg" alt="Laptop in tablet mode." width="960" height="400">
</figure>

<p>
	This is my first-ever experience with a "convertible" laptop. I've actively
	avoided such laptops in the past because I strongly dislike their
	"tent-style" flip-over hinges. Why would I want the bottom to be the
	keyboard?? Disgusting. The Dell 7214 has a much better solution.
</p>

<figure class="pull-right">
	<img src="https://cdn.blackieops.com/alexblackie/dell-7214/flippy.jpg" alt="Laptop screen mid-flip." width="403" height="350">
</figure>

<p>
	The screen is actually two parts: an outer frame and an inner screen housing.
	The inner part swivels around on its midpoint, allowing you to click down the
	lid and have a tablet-like experience without any of the nasty exposed
	keyboard or weird hinges. Note my use of "tablet-like", as this is still a
	3kg machine, so holding it comfortably with one hand is a long-shot.
</p>

<p>
	I find myself using this functionality much more than I thought. It's
	incredibly nice to open a long article, flip the screen and read it in
	portrait mode on the couch.
</p>

<p>
	And, as is inevitable, I have begun poking at my work laptop's screen
	involuntarily, forgetting it is just a normal non-touch screen.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="linux" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Linux Support</h3>

<p>
	I was pleasantly surprised to find that almost all parts of this laptop are
	compatible out-of-the-box with modern Linux. GPS, LTE modem, touchscreen,
	rotation accelerometer&hellip; Everything worked out-of-the-box (at least on
	Fedora 28) and without any intervention from myself. The only exception is
	the fingerprint reader, but I have not had one of those work under Linux in
	years.
</p>

<p>
	GNOME, specifically, has been an absolute pleasure. I've used GNOME for many
	years on "normal" laptops, but I'm consistently surprised by just how well it
	handles the "convertible" features: the on-screen keyboard is just a swipe-up
	away, rotation lock buttons appear in the system menu, basically every touch
	target is plenty large for my stubby fingers&hellip; If anything has renewed
	my faith in GNOME, it has been my experiences since using it on this machine.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="anywhere" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Working from Anywhere</h3>

<p>
	I was glad to see that the model I bought came with a built-in LTE modem and
	dedicated GPS module. The SIM slot takes a MicroSIM-sized card, so
	unfortunately none of mine would fit properly, and thus I haven't had a
	chance to test it yet.
</p>

<p>
	I've always loved the idea of having LTE connectivity in my laptop. Thinkpads
	have had the option for a long while, but I never opted to pay for the
	upgrade. I love the idea that no matter where I am in the world, I can get a
	prepaid or pay-as-you-go data SIM, pop it into my laptop, and never be
	without an internet connection. This is obviously great for travelling, but
	also just if I end up in a coffeeshop that doesn't have WiFi.
</p>

<a class="scrollAnchor" name="slots" data-parent="good"></a>
<h3>Too many slots</h3>

<p>
	This is the first machine I've ever owned that has an ExpressCard slot, and
	as of now I have no idea what to use it for. It seems the best option is to
	get a card with a pair of USB3 ports on it, expanding the weak USB offering
	of the machine.
</p>

<p>
	Additionally, this is the first machine I've owned with a smartcard reader.
	This takes two forms: there's a contactless reader in the palmrest, and a
	full smartcard slot underneath the ExpressCard bay. Similar to the
	ExpressCard slot, I'm unsure how to take advantage of this new functionality;
	a quick search shows that smartcards are difficult to buy for quantities
	under 100, and open source compatibility isn't always guaranteed.
</p>

<p>
	I also fear if I come to love both of these features, I will be disappointed
	in the future when they are inevitably impossible to find in newer laptops.
	Best to enjoy it while it lasts, I guess.

<h2>In Brief</h2>

<p>
	The Dell Latitude 7214 "Rugged Extreme" is a lot of laptop for one person to
	handle. It's heavy, bulky, thick, and makes a lot of compromises to achieve
	many of its certifications and goals. However, if you are willing to accept
	these compromises, you get a machine with one hell of a spec sheet.
</p>

<p>
	This is not a machine I would generally recommend. To enjoy this machine, you
	need to have rather peculiar desires and be willing to go out of your way to
	satisfy them. If you're willing to compromise on the weight, thickness,
	display quality, and trackpad for a machine that will probably survive in
	environments a human cannot, the Dell Latitude 7214 certainly delivers.

<p>
	Did I mention it has RGB?
