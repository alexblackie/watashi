<p>
  Docker and other containerization technologies are making the rounds in the Linux community, but a lowly hero lurks beneath now every major Linux distro; enter `systemd-nspawn` containers.
</p>

<p>
  systemd has arrived with mixed reviews -- you either love it or you hate it -- but one thing stands for certain: it gets the job done. Regardless of your emotions projected towards it, systemd is likely here to stay for a while, so you might as well exploit as many features as you can out of it.
</p>

<p>
  <code>systemd-nspawn</code> containers are akin to FreeBSD Jails more than Docker containers. They&#39;re basically just a fancy `chroot` with some handy built-in integrations with systemd. You can start, stop, enable, and disable the containers as if they were regular services.
</p>

<p>
  Keep in mind, however, that by its own admission, <code>systemd-nspawn</code> is an experimental feature that hasn&#39;t been thoroughly tested or audited. There are no guarantees of security or stability; it&#39;s probably best to keep them out of production for the time being.
</p>

<h3>Creating the container</h3>

<p>
  We will be working on a fresh install of CentOS 7, but this process is possible on any system using systemd. The only difference will be the first package installation step. Obviously, on Debian you will not be using <code>yum</code>, and on Fedora your repo names and release versions will be different (and you'll be using <code>dnf</code>)&hellip;
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  First step is to install a new root filesystem into a directory.
</p>

<pre><code># yum -y --releasever=7 --nogpg --installroot=/var/lib/machines/cool-container \
  --disablerepo='*' --enablerepo=base install systemd passwd yum centos-release
</code></pre>

<p>
  This will create a directory, <code>/var/lib/machines/cool-container</code>, and populate it with a new root filesystem and a couple core packages.
</p>

<p>
  Second, we need to enter into the container to set up some basic things like the <code>root</code> password. We can use the <code>systemd-nspawn</code> command directly for this:
</p>

<pre><code># systemd-nspawn -D /var/lib/machines/cool-container
</code></pre>

<p>
  This drops you to a shell in the container without actually &quot;booting&quot; anything inside of it (think of it as like <code>chroot</code>-ing from a recovery mode. From here, we can set the root password so we can log in later.
</p>

<p>
  When you&#39;re done, just <code>^D</code> out as usual and you&#39;ll be dropped back to your host machine.
</p>

<h3>Aside: kernel auditing and containers</h3>

<p>
  If you ignore this section and continue trying to boot the container, you will likely get a warning before the container starts about the kernel auditing subsystem. There are supposedly odd bugs that can surface if auditing is enabled, so we&#39;re just going to disable it. If this worries you, feel free to inspect the issue further, but since this is not a production system it&#39;s probably fine.
</p>

<p>
  We just need to add a flag to the kernel parameters in our bootloader. This will vary between distros, but for CentOS it's as easy as editing the <code>/etc/sysconfig/grub</code> and changing the <code>GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX</code> variable by appending <code>audit=0</code> to the list of parameters.
</p>

<p>
  After editing the parameters, we'll need to regenerate our GRUB configuration:
</p>

<pre><code># grub2-mkconfig -o /etc/grub2.cfg
</code></pre>

<h3>Configuring the base system</h3>

<p>
  We now have a skeleton of a container installed, but we still need to actually configure what&#39;s inside of it, and get it prepped to start automatically, or at least as a service from systemd.
</p>

<p>
  Since we now have access to the <code>root</code> account, we can fully &quot;boot&quot; the container:
</p>

<pre><code># systemd-nspawn -bD /var/lib/machines/cool-container
</code></pre>

<p>
  The <code>-b</code> flag is short for <code>--boot</code> and basically means <code>systemd-nspawn</code> will search for an init binary and execute it. You&#39;ll see the standard boot log fly by, and then be dropped at a standard PTY login prompt. Log in with the root credentials you set up previously, and now we can start installing things as if we were on a brand new machine.
</p>

<p>
  Once you have your container set up and everything is running and configured, you can exit by &quot;shutting down&quot; the container as if it was a physical machine: <code>poweroff</code> or <code>halt</code> (or whatever you usually use).
</p>

<h3>Managing the container</h3>

<p>
  While the <code>/var/lib/machines</code> prefix at the beginning may have seemed arbitrary, in fact it was intentional -- containers in this directory will be auto-discovered by systemd and we can enable and manage them automatically.
</p>

<p>
  To have your container start with everything else when your host boots:
</p>

<pre><code># systemctl enable systemd-nspawn@cool-container
</code></pre>

<p>
  And as you can perhaps guess, we can start and stop our container just as any other service:
</p>

<pre><code># systemctl start systemd-nspawn@cool-container
# systemctl stop systemd-nspawn@cool-container
</code></pre>

<h3>Accessing the container</h3>

<p>
  Accessing a running container can be a bit tricky; one option is to install <code>openssh</code> in the container and have it run on a non-standard port (as containers share the host&#39;s network interfaces).  Alternatively, you can access the machine through <code>machinectl</code>.
</p>

<p>
  Just running <code>machinectl</code> without arguments will list all running containers (and other VMs, etc). Interestingly, the older version of <code>machinectl</code> on CentOS does not allow us to use the <code>login</code> argument (so you may want to install <code>openssh</code>)... If you're on Fedora (or a different more up-to-date distro), we can use <code>machinectl login</code> command:
</p>

<pre><code># machinectl login cool-container
</code></pre>

<p>
  ... which will drop us at that familiar PTY prompt.
</p>

<p>
  Since we don't necessarily want to halt the container to escape from this prompt, there is a panic button to disconnect: hit escape three times within a second (i.e., fast).
</p>

<hr>

<p>
  In conclusion, <code>systemd-nspawn</code> is an interesting technology that shows promise.  Its ubiquity through the proliferation of systemd means containers are quite portable, easy to set up, and well-integrated directly into the OS's init system.
</p>

<p>
  However, should you use it in production? Probably not. It's a very green technology and its immaturity is a bit too worrisome to bet the farm on. For production containers, FreeBSD Jails or Docker still are your best bet.
</p>

<p>
  For now, <code>systemd-nspawn</code> is staying on my internal infrastructure, running my Atlassian stack, Jenkins, etc.; and it is running those internal services quite well. But until its features are more solidified and someone has verified it is at least moderately secure, it won&#39;t be finding its way to my production stack for a few years yet.
