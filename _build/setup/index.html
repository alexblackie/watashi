	<h2>My Setup</h2>

	<p>
		I always love reading about how other people use their computers and
		desks.  Sites like <a href="https://usesthis.com/">UsesThis</a> and
		Simple Desks (R.I.P.) have taken many hours of my life, and I have
		taken inspiration from them many times. This page will serve as a
		perpetually-updated reference for how I'm currently using my computer.

	<h2>Hardware</h2>

	<p>
		My current &ldquo;Daily Driver&rdquo; computer is the <strong>Dell XPS 13
		(9380)</strong>. It's plenty fast, thin and light, has a fantastic
		screen, great WiFi performance, and a decently comfortable keyboard.
		High-DPI under Linux is still hit-and-miss, but the laptop itself is
		probably one of the best computers I've owned.
	</p>

	<p>
		Primarily, I use 2x <strong>Dell U2415 24" 1200p Monitors</strong> (on a dual
		monitor arm), a <a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3508"><strong>Varmilo Sakura TKL</strong></a>
		mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches, and a
		<strong>Logitech MX Master</strong> (V1) mouse. Since video calls are a
		frequent occurrence, I have a <strong>Logitech C920 webcam</strong> and
		a <strong>Blue Yeti</strong> &ldquo;Blackout Edition&rdquo; microphone,
		shock-mounted to a Blue mic boom. Everything is plugged into a
		<strong>CalDigit TS3+ Thunderbolt Dock</strong> which allows me to live
		the "one cable" lifestyle, and I love it.
	</p>

	<p>
		For work, I have a standard-issue <strong>15" Macbook Pro
		(2019)</strong>, which plugs into the same Thunderbolt dock (the future
		is here). I also swap out the MX Master for an <strong>Apple Magic
		Trackpad</strong> because mouse support in macOS is insufferable.
	</p>

	<h2>Software</h2>

	<p>
		Probably the most accurate and detailed information about my software setup
		is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> and
		<a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the Ansible playbooks</a>
		that I use to provision my workstations.
	</p>

	<p>
		For operating systems, I tend to stick to the latest <strong>Fedora
		Workstation</strong> release. For my work-provided Macbook I am
		of course stuck with macOS, unfortunately. For non-desktop machines,
		<strong>CentOS</strong> is my server OS of choice, though Kubernetes
		has made that less important in recent years.
	</p>

	<p>
		My desktop environment of choice has been <strong>GNOME</strong> for many
		years, and I run it nearly stock, with only <a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/517/caffeine/">two</a>
		<a href="https://extensions.gnome.org/extension/906/sound-output-device-chooser/">extensions</a>
		enabled. I spend a significant amount of my time
		in <strong>Firefox</strong> and <strong>vim</strong>. For larger
		projects, especially where IDE-ish features become useful, I tend to use
		<strong>Visual Studio Code</strong>, almost exclusively for Intellisense
		and the side-by-side markdown preview mode.
	</p>

	<p>
		I exclusively use a local music library, all of which I have purchased and
		built up over many years. On macOS I'm still unfortunately stuck using
		<strong><s>iTunes</s> Music.app</strong>, which is very slow, clunky, and
		buggy. On Linux, I use <a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Lollypop"><strong>Lollypop</strong></a>
		which works very well and is a model for how music library apps should be done.
