<div class="singleArticle--body">
			<p>
	For a while now I have done all my dayjob work within a VM over SSH and
	Samba. This has worked quite well, and meant I could keep my development
	environment a bit more slow-moving (generally, the latest Ubuntu LTS) while
	running a faster-moving desktop distribution on the hardware itself. It
	also means when I travel I can <code>rsync</code> the VM to my personal
	laptop and not have to lug two laptops with me everywhere just to keep that
	work/personal separation.
</p>

<p>
	<strong>So. I tried to install updates</strong>. About halfway through
	installing updates, something I do a couple times a week usually, the VM
	froze. The SSH connection was responsive but I could tell all disk I/O was
	totally dead, and basically nothing worked -- not even closing a shell
	session. I opened the VM's console display and sure enough there was a
	screen full of watchdog warnings saying the Kernel had hung. I gave it a
	couple minutes but it seemed clear that something had gone horribly wrong.
</p>

<p>
	As it turns out, the virtual disk image I had copied from another computer
	was in VirtualBox format, and something in the driver in QEMU/KVM would
	cause it to completely stall periodically. Of course, this failure occurred
	at the worst time -- in the middle of installing updates -- and so this is
	my tale of trying to repair the VM once I rebooted it.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">~ % sudo apt update</div>
<pre><code>Hit:1 http://archive.ubuntu.com/ubuntu bionic InRelease

<p>
	As always, make sure to glare disapprovingly at the <code>http://</code>
	plastered across your screen, knowing that even if you added an
	<code>s</code> it would not work because no one seems to provide secure
	Debian package mirrors, and unless you installed some extension package
	(over plain HTTP of course) <code>apt</code> doesn't even support secure
	connections.
</p>

<p>
	<code>All packages are up to date.</code> Um, well, that's entirely false.
	As soon as I saw this I knew I was in for a wild ride, and started thinking
	through how much work it would be to just rebuild the VM from scratch.
</p>

<p>
	I lost my shell history for this part but I had to eventually find out to
	run some <code>dpkg</code> command to "resume" the in-flight upgrade:
</p>

<pre><code>dpkg --configure --some-other-flags-i-think</code></pre>

<p>
	That did a bunch of stuff, seemingly finished the upgrade successfully.
</p>

<p>
	&ldquo;Well, let's just try again!&rdquo;
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">~ % sudo apt dist-upgrade</div>
<pre><code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: The package libgl1-mesa-dri needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.</code></pre></div>

<p>
	At least we're getting an error again.
</p>

<p>
	I first tried <code>apt reinstall</code> which I always forget does not
	exist. I moved on to just trying to remove and install it myself&hellip;
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">~ % sudo apt remove libgl1-mesa-dri</div>
<pre><code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: The package libgl1-mesa-dri needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.</code></pre></div>

<p>
	Yes&hellip; Thanks, I know&hellip; &ldquo;Sorry, we can't remove this package
	because we can't find a locally cached tarball to upgrade it, and
	apparently can't just redownload it from the repo&rdquo;&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	With my hope dwindling, I finally tried the old <code>install -f</code>,
	which works when you install a <code>deb</code> manually, which often
	requires you to temporarily break your system until you <code>install -f</code>.
	Installing a <code>deb</code> is an unfortunate process (that is slowly
	getting better with <code>apt</code> replacing <code>apt-get</code>) but that's not the topic for
	today's discussion.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">~ % sudo apt install -f</div>
<pre><code>Reading package lists... Done
Building dependency tree
Reading state information... Done
E: The package libgl1-mesa-dri needs to be reinstalled, but I can't find an archive for it.</code></pre></div>

<p>
	Nope.
</p>

<p>
	My patience growing thin I finally resorted to copying and pasting the
	error into a search engine. StackOverflow, of course, delivered.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">~ % sudo dpkg --remove --force-all libgl1-mesa-dri</div>
<pre><code> dpkg: libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64: dependency problems, but removing anyway as you requested:
 libglx-mesa0:amd64 depends on libgl1-mesa-dri.

 dpkg: warning: overriding problem because --force enabled:
 dpkg: warning: package is in a very bad inconsistent state; you should
  reinstall it before attempting a removal
  (Reading database ... 166745 files and directories currently installed.)
  Removing libgl1-mesa-dri:amd64 (18.2.8-0ubuntu0~18.04.2) ...</code></pre></div>

<p>
	<code>dpkg</code>, of course, complains, but does do as asked, and removes
	the broken package from the system. Finally.
</p>

<p>
	Now I can finally just run <code>apt install --fix-broken</code> which
	installed some various packages, their importance at this point not top of
	mind. At this point I am so tired of trying to fix the system I do not
	care.
</p>

<p>
	I can now run <code>apt</code> again, and running a subsequent <code>apt upgrade</code> was successful.
</p>

<hr>

<p>
	After all of this, I just cannot help but think about <code>dnf</code>. I
	have experienced failed upgrades in Fedora! It has happened! But because
	<code>dnf</code> gracefully knows a previous transaction was aborted it has
	facilities to resolve the situation, either through rolling back, retrying,
	or at the very least just letting you see up front what the state of your
	system is, without having to search for some arcane flags to a piece of
	software you never interact with (<code>dpkg</code>).
</p>

<p>
	The split-brain between <code>apt</code> and <code>dpkg</code> makes for a
	bit of a confusing mess, especially when the state gets out of sync between
	them, as was just chronicled in this post.
</p>

<p>
	The focus on this in recent years with <code>apt</code> is a glimmer of
	hope that this situation will improve in the Debian ecosystem. I work with
	Ubuntu systems regularly, and I always pine for <code>dnf</code> or
	<code>yum</code> most of the time. I sincerely hope Debian can catch up to
	where <code>dnf</code> has pulled ahead, and help one of the most
	widely-deployed operating systems in the world a little more stable and
	trustworthy.
