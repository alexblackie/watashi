			Greetings. I am a web developer, systems administrator, "DevOps"
			automator, and sometimes a drummer. I have been fortunate in my nearly
			decade-long career to have a chance to work at all levels of the web
			stack: from enterprise JavaScript SPA's, to cloud-native backend APIs
			in various languages, to various DevOps and infrastructure projects in
			and below the Cloud. Je parle un peu français, et
			私は少し日本語を話しいます。

			<p>
				I started my career doing freelance web development (primarily using WordPress) for local businesses under the name of <strong>X96 Design</strong>. I never made enough yearly income to warrant paying taxes, and did a lot of work for experience. However, since I was 13 at the time, that was just fine.

			<p>
				I applied for a summer internship at <strong><a href="https://metalab.co">Metalab</a></strong> and somehow landed a job as frontend web developer. My colleagues there taught me more than I could have ever imagined, including the magic of caffeine (thanks, Steven). Near the end of my time here, I helped build the original prototypes of <strong>Flow Chat</strong>.

			<p>
				I moved to <strong><a href="https://stembolt.com">Stembolt</a></strong> (defunct 2018), building eCommerce sites in Rails. It was here that my interest in production engineering became realised. A company full of Linux users and backend developers was a significantly different experience, and I was able to learn so much from my colleagues during my time there.

			<span class="timelineStep--date">2017</span>
			<p>
				Joining <strong><a href="https://www.getflow.com">Flow</a></strong> as an API Developer, I lead many backend engineering projects with Rails and Elixir as well as directly planning, implementing, and maintaining critical production infrastructure and operations.

				Most recently, I have joined <strong><a href="https://www.shopify.ca">Shopify</a></strong>, where I am looking forward to greater challenges and opportunities to grow and learn.
