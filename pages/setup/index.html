			<h2>Hardware</h2>

			<p>
				My "daily driver" computer is the <mark>Macbook Pro 14"</mark>
				(2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD). I've been a "Linux on the
				desktop" person for most of my life, but I was lured back to
				the Mac with the fantastic new hardware that came with the ARM
				transition. Plus unlike Linux on the desktop, it works reliably
				when being used by humans.
			</p>

			<p>
				Centre-stage is an <mark>Apple Studio Display</mark> (27", 5k).
				I used to be a multi-monitor person, but I found it often
				harmed my ability to focus; dropping down to one monitor has
				helped tame distractions. The 5K resolution is also a welcome
				respite from the pixelated PC monitors of yore.
			</p>

			<p>
				For input, I use a <mark>Leopold FC660C</mark> with Topre
				Silent 45g switches. This is the best keyboard I have ever
				owned; the extra tactility and premium softness of the
				topre keys is heavenly. The wood wrist rest in front of it was
				custom-made by a friend and matches the keyboard dimensions
				exactly.
			</p>

			<p>
				For pointing, I use an <mark>Apple Magic Trackpad 2</mark>.
				Whenever I have used Macs, I have loved using Apple's wireless
				trackpads, going back to the first one in 2010. I do also have
				an original <mark>Logitech MX Master</mark> which I keep around
				mostly for games.
			</p>

			<p>
				For music listening, I have a pair of <mark>Yamaha HS5</mark>
				monitors, powered by an <mark>Audient iD4</mark> audio
				interface. I also have a pair of <mark>Beyerdynamic DT-770
				Pros</mark> (the 250&ohm; variant) which plug into the same
				interface. Finally, I have a pair of <mark>Airpods Pro</mark>
				which I use for listening to stuff around or out of the house.

				<h2>Software</h2>

				<p>
					Probably the best resource for the details on my software
					setup is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
					and <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the ansible playbooks</a>
					that set up all my machines.
				</p>

				<p>
					For getting work done, I switch between <mark>Microsoft Edge</mark>
					and <mark>Safari</mark> for web-based things, <mark>neovim</mark>
					for text editing, <mark>kitty</mark> for terminal
					emulation, <mark>Docker</mark> for containing, and
					<mark>Todoist</mark> for managing my life with lists.
					Email, Calendar, and most other things all happen in the
					browser these days.
				</p>

				<p>
					I maintain my own music library which I host with
					with <mark>Plex</mark>, and access with
					<mark>Plexamp</mark> on macOS and <mark>Prism</mark> on
					iOS. The experience is better than any streaming service, I
					get to keep my obscure music, and can directly support artists
					by buying their albums.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cloud infrastructure is generally on
					<mark>Microsoft Azure</mark> with some secondary stuff on
					<mark>Linode</mark> and <mark>OVH</mark>. Cloud
					resources are automated with <mark>Terraform</mark>, and
					non-Kubernetes servers are configured using
					<mark>Ansible</mark> playbooks.
				</p>

				<p>
					For myself and my family I run or manage a few services,
					including <mark>Nextcloud</mark> for file syncing and
					storage, <mark>Fastmail</mark> for email and workgroups,
					<mark>Tailscale</mark> for a mesh VPN and secure traffic
					tunneling, and <mark>Azure AD</mark> for secure
					identity management and SSO.

				<h2>Furniture</h2>

				<p>
					My desk is a near-death <mark>Ikea Bekant</mark> motorised
					sit/stand model. It barely survived moving across the
					country and is literally falling apart. It's still sturdy
					enough for now, and gets the job done.
				</p>

				<p>
					For sitting, I have a "fully loaded" <mark>Herman Miller Mirra 2</mark>
					chair. It is incredibly comfortable, perhaps <em>too</em>
					comfortable as I often forget to stand during the day.
