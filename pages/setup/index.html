		I always love reading about how other people use their computers and
		desks.  Sites like <a href="https://usesthis.com/">UsesThis</a> and
		Simple Desks (R.I.P.) have taken many hours of my life, and I have
		taken inspiration from them many times. This page will serve as a
		perpetually-updated reference for how I'm currently using my computer.

	<h2>Hardware</h2>

	<p>
		My current &ldquo;Daily Driver&rdquo; computer is the <strong>Macbook
			Pro 13" (2020, Intel)</strong>. It's the last model before the M1
		switch, just to save first-generation headaches. Apple won me back
		after a few years of exclusive Linux on the Desktop&trade; with their
		recent return to making really solid hardware, as well as the exciting
		ARM-based future.
	</p>

	<p>
		Primarily, I use 2x <strong>Dell U2415 24" 1200p Monitors</strong>, a
		<a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3508"><strong>Varmilo Sakura TKL</strong></a>
		mechanical keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches, and an
		<strong>Apple Magic Trackpad 2</strong>. For looking good on video
		calls I have a <strong>Logitech C920 webcam</strong>.
	</p>

	<p>
		For audio input, I use a <strong>Blue Yeti</strong> &ldquo;Blackout Edition&rdquo; microphone,
		shock-mounted to a Blue mic boom. For audio output, I have a
		<strong>Mayflower Electronics O2+ODAC</strong> driving a pair of
		<strong>Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pro</strong>'s (the 250&ohm; variant). The
		DT-770's are probably my favourite pair of headphones I have used to
		date.
	</p>

	<p>
		Everything is plugged into a <strong>CalDigit TS3+ Thunderbolt
			Dock</strong> which allows me to live the "one cable" lifestyle,
		and it makes my laptop-only reality a pleasant experience.
	</p>

	<p>
		The laptop itself is held in a <a href="https://www.apple.com/ca/shop/product/HP9X2ZM/A/twelve-south-bookarc-stand-for-macbook"><strong>TwelveSouth BookArc Stand</strong></a>
		which holds it vertically, meaning I can hide the laptop itself behind
		my monitors for a cleaner aesthetic.
	</p>

	<p>
		For my job, I have a standard-issue <strong>15" Macbook Pro
			(2019)</strong>, which plugs into the same Thunderbolt dock. The
		extra juice from the high-watt CPU and discrete GPU is certainly
		nice, but it is just so dang big, and is a constant reminder
		that I prefer smaller laptops.
	</p>

	<p>
		I still have my <strong>Dell XPS 13 9380</strong>, but at this point I
		have replaced it entirely with the Macbook Pro. The XPS 13 was a
		fantastic laptop, but after only 1.5 years of ownership it has started
		failing &mdash; the battery capacity has dropped to 52%, the webcam
		shorts out if you move the lid, the trackpad doesn't click reliably,
		and HiDPI under Linux is still very hit-or-miss. I wish I could
		recommend it but it just did not last an acceptable amount of time
		before degrading.
	</p>

	<h2>Software</h2>

	<p>
		Probably the most accurate and detailed information about my software setup
		is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> and
		<a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the Ansible playbooks</a>
		that I use to provision my computers. Otherwise...
	</p>

	<p>
		I spend the significant majority of my time in <strong>Firefox</strong>
		and <strong>neovim</strong>. At work I am often forced to use
		<strong>VS Code</strong> which is &ldquo;fine.&rdquo; I use the
		standard <strong>Terminal.app</strong> because I've used
		<strong>tmux</strong> my entire life and don't need the approximately
		one-billion features of iTerm2.
	</p>

	<p>
		I use a lot of containers, which on macOS unfortunately means
		I'm stuck with <strong>Docker</strong>. It's still the best
		experience for now, but I hope one day I can use
		<code>podman</code> or some other, more open technology instead.
	</p>

	<p>
		I also use <a href="https://kapeli.com/dash"><strong>Dash</strong></a>
		quite a bit for local and easily-searchable documentation for
		various languages, libraries, and frameworks. Much faster than
		searching the web, and everything being offline is nice.
	</p>

	<h2>The <em>Cloud&trade;</em></h2>

	<p>
		The majority of my personal cloud infrastructure runs on
		<strong>Microsoft Azure</strong>, specifically
		<strong>AKS</strong>, <strong>Azure Storage</strong>, and a few
		standalone VMs. Everything is tracked and deployed with
		<strong>Terraform</strong>, and everything is kept within
		Canadian regions.
	</p>

	<p>
		For file syncing and cloud storage, I run a private
		<strong>Nextcloud</strong> installation for myself and my family
		(I <a href="/articles/nextcloud-on-k8s/">have written in the
			past</a> about how I run Nextcloud on Kubernetes). It's
		been the key to getting us out of Google's ecosystem and I love
		it just for that, even if it is a large PHP nightmare.
