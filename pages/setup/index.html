			<h2>Hardware</h2>

			<p>
				My "daily driver" computer is the <mark>Macbook Pro 14"</mark>
				(2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD). I've been a "Linux on the
				desktop" person for most of my life, but I was lured back to
				the Mac with the fantastic new hardware that came with the ARM
				transition. Plus unlike Linux on the desktop, it works reliably
				when being used by humans.
			</p>

			<p>
				Centre-stage are two <mark>Dell Ultrasharp U2415</mark> 24"
				1200p displays. Generally I have preferred having two discrete
				displays over one larger one because it helps my brain separate
				things, and can make window mangement/fullscreen apps easier.
			</p>

			<p>
				For input, I use a <mark>Leopold FC660C</mark> with Topre
				Silent 45g switches. This is the best keyboard I have ever
				owned; the extra tactility and premium softness of the
				topre keys is heavenly. The wood wrist rest in front of it was
				custom-made by a friend and matches the keyboard dimensions
				exactly.
			</p>

			<p>
				For pointing, I use an <mark>Apple Magic Trackpad 2</mark>.
				Whenever I have used Macs, I have loved using Apple's wireless
				trackpads, going back to the first one in 2010. I do also have
				an original <mark>Logitech MX Master</mark> which I keep around
				mostly for games.
			</p>

			<p>
				For music listening, I have a pair of <mark>Yamaha HS5</mark>
				monitors, powered by an <mark>Audient iD4</mark> audio
				interface. I also have a pair of <mark>Beyerdynamic DT-770
				Pros</mark> (the 250&ohm; variant) which plug into the same
				interface. Finally, I have a pair of <mark>Airpods Pro</mark>
				which I use for listening to stuff around or out of the house.
			</p>

			<p>
				Working remotely means a lot of video calls, and so I use a
				<mark>Blue Yeti</mark> microphone bolted to a shock-mount on a
				matching Blue-branded arm. I found a generic furry pop filter
				cover for it, which works well and looks hilarious.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything mentioned above is connected to my laptop with one
				thunderbolt cable via a <mark>Caldigit TS3+</mark> dock.

				<h2>Software</h2>

				<p>
					Probably the best resource for the details on my software
					setup is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
					and <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the ansible playbooks</a>
					that set up all my machines.
				</p>

				<p>
					For operating systems, I of course run <mark>macOS</mark>
					primarily, but on my non-Apple computers I generally stick
					to the latest release of <mark>Fedora Workstation</mark>.
				</p>

				<p>
					For getting work done, I use <mark>Firefox</mark> or
					<mark>Safari</mark> for web-based things,
					<mark>neovim</mark> for text editing, <mark>kitty</mark>
					for terminal emulation, <mark>Docker</mark> for containing,
					and <mark>Todoist</mark> for managing my life with lists.
					Email, Calendar, and most other things all happen in the
					browser these days.
				</p>

				<p>
					I maintain my own semi-local music library which I play
					with <mark>Music.app</mark> and supplement with Apple
					Music, which also helps with syncing between my devices. On
					Linux I sync music with the rest of my files through
					Nextcloud, and use the lovely <mark>Lollypop</mark> music
					player.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cloud infrastructure is generally on
					<mark>Microsoft Azure</mark> with some secondary stuff in
					<mark>Linode</mark> and <mark>Scaleway</mark>. Cloud
					resources are automated with <mark>Terraform</mark>, and
					all servers are configured using <mark>Ansible</mark>
					playbooks.
				</p>

				<p>
					For myself and my family I run or manage a few services,
					including <mark>Nextcloud</mark> for file syncing and
					storage, <mark>Fastmail</mark> for email and workgroups,
					<mark>Tailscale</mark> for a mesh VPN and secure traffic
					tunneling, and <mark>Azure AD</mark> for secure
					identity management and SSO.
				</p>

				<h2>Furniture</h2>

				<p>
					My desk is a near-death <mark>Ikea Bekant</mark> motorised
					sit/stand model. It barely survived moving across the
					country and is literally falling apart. It's still sturdy
					enough for now, and gets the job done.
				</p>

				<p>
					For sitting, I have a "fully loaded" <mark>Herman Miller Mirra 2</mark>
					chair. It is incredibly comfortable, perhaps <em>too</em>
					comfortable as I often forget to stand during the day.
