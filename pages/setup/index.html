			<h2>Hardware</h2>

			<p>
				My "daily driver" computer is the <mark>Macbook Pro 13"</mark>
				(2020, Intel). I've been a Linux-on-the-desktop person for most
				of my life, but Apple has got their hardware game back, and the
				ARM transition is pretty exciting, so it won me back for now.
			</p>

			<p>
				Centre-stage are two <mark>Dell Ultrasharp U2415</mark> 24"
				1200p displays. Generally I have preferred having two discrete
				displays over one larger one because it helps my brain separate
				things, and can make window mangement/fullscreen apps easier.
			</p>

			<p>
				For input, I use a <mark>Leopold FC660C</mark> with Topre
				Silent 45g switches. This is the best keyboard I have ever
				owned; the extra tactility and premium softness of the
				topre keys is heavenly. The wood wrist rest in front of it was
				custom-made by a friend and matches the keyboard dimensions
				exactly.
			</p>

			<p>
				For pointing, I use an <mark>Apple Magic Trackpad 2</mark>.
				Whenever I have used Macs, I have loved using Apple's wireless
				trackpads, going back to the first one in 2010. I do also have
				an original <mark>Logitech MX Master</mark> which I keep around
				mostly for games.
			</p>

			<p>
				For music listening, I have a pair of <mark>Yamaha HS5</mark>
				monitors, powered by an <mark>Audient iD4</mark> audio
				interface. I also have a pair of <mark>Beyerdynamic DT-770
				Pros</mark> (the 250&ohm; variant) which plug into the same
				interface. Finally, I have a pair of <mark>Airpods Pro</mark>
				which I use for listening to stuff around or out of the house.
			</p>

			<p>
				Working remotely means a lot of video calls, and so I use a
				<mark>Blue Yeti</mark> microphone bolted to a shock-mount on a
				matching Blue-branded arm. I found a generic furry pop filter
				cover for it, which works well and looks hilarious.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything mentioned above is connected to my laptop with one
				thunderbolt cable via a <mark>Caldigit TS3+</mark> dock. The
				laptop itself is tucked behind the monitors in a
				<mark>TwelveSouth BookArc</mark> vertical stand.

				<h2>Software</h2>

				<p>
					Probably the best resource for the details on my software
					setup is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
					and <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the ansible playbooks</a>
					that set up all my machines.
				</p>

				<p>
					For operating systems, I of course run <mark>macOS</mark>
					primarily, but on my non-Apple computers I generally stick
					to <mark>Ubuntu</mark> LTS.
				</p>

				<p>
					For getting work done, I use <mark>Firefox</mark> for
					web-based things, <mark>Safari</mark> when Firefox annoys
					me too much, <mark>neovim</mark> for text editing,
					<mark>kitty</mark> for terminal emulation,
					<mark>Docker</mark> for containing, and generally just use
					the default Apple apps for mail and calendar. On Linux,
					it's all the same, just with the web versions for mail and
					calendar.
				</p>

				<p>
					I maintain my own semi-local music library which I play
					with <mark>Music.app</mark> and begrudgingly pay for Apple
					Music for easier syncing between my devices. On Linux I
					sync music with the rest of my files through Nextcloud, and
					use the lovely <mark>Lollypop</mark> music player.
				</p>

				<p>
					For "cloud storage" needs I run a private
					<mark>Nextcloud</mark> instance for myself and my family,
					which keeps our data under our control and within Canadian
					datacentres. I <a href="/articles/nextcloud-on-k8s/">wrote a blog post</a>
					about how I run Nextcloud, for those that are curious.
				</p>

				<h2>The Cloud&trade;</h2>

				<p>
					For cloud infrastructure, I primarily use <mark>Microsoft Azure</mark>
					&mdash; specifically Azure Kubernetes Service, Azure
					Container Registry, Azure Storage, and a couple standalone
					VMs.
				</p>

				<p>
					I run everything in Canadian regions, with the exception of
					a real-time disaster recovery mirror in Azure's Switzerland
					region. I also maintain regularly-tested backups of
					everything on a second geopolitically-independent cloud
					provider in the EU, as well as on-premises on hardware in
					my apartment.
