		I always love reading about how other people use their computers and
		desks.  Sites like <a href="https://usesthis.com/">UsesThis</a> and
		Simple Desks (R.I.P.) have taken many hours of my life, and I have
		taken inspiration from them many times. This page will serve as a
		perpetually-updated reference for how I'm currently using my computer.

<h2>Hardware</h2>

<p>
	After several years and various laptops and operating systems, I have
	finally landed on a maxed-out <strong>Dell XPS 13 (9380)</strong>. It's
	plenty fast, thin and light, has a fantastic screen, great WiFi
	performance, and a rather comfortable keyboard with keys that actually
	move. It's a fair departure from my Thinkpad lineage, but I quite like it.
</p>

<p>
	At home, I use a <strong>Dell U2415 24" 1200p Monitor</strong>, a
	<strong>Filco Majestouch 2 Ninja</strong> mechanical keyboard with Cherry
	MX Brown switches and a third-party set of PBT keycaps, and a
	<strong>Logitech MX Master</strong> (V1) mouse.
</p>

<p>
	On the go, I usually carry a foldable laptop stand (it's a generic Chinese
	knock-off of the "Roost"), and a <strong>Logitech K380</strong> bluetooth
	keyboard. This combination means I can have a ergonomic setup at coworking
	spaces, cafes, or wherever I need to get work done. Yes, I know the K380
	isn't mechanical. It's nothing special, but it's not disgusting to type on.
</p>

<p>
	I also have a <strong>Thinkpad T460p</strong> with one the high-watt mobile
	CPU SKUs. This laptop has been very disappointing. This was, and probably
	will continue to be, the last Thinkpad I used. Lenovo has soiled the holy
	name of Thinkpad.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
	Probably the most accurate and detailed information about my software setup
	is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> and
	<a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the Ansible playbooks</a>
	that I use to provision my workstations.
</p>

<p>
	On most machines, I tend to stick to the latest <strong>Fedora
	Workstation</strong> release. On some occasions, I may also use the latest
	<strong>Ubuntu Desktop LTS</strong> depending on my mood or the machine's
	role.
</p>

<p>
	I spend a significant amount of time in <strong>Firefox</strong> and
	<strong>vim</strong>. My shell of choice is <strong>zsh</strong> though for
	many years I used and still have a strong respect for bash. Depending
	on my mood, I might use <strong>Sublime Text 3</strong>, which is also
	an excellent editor.
</p>

<p>
	I exclusively use a local music library, all of which I have purchased and
	built up over many years. On macOS I'm still unfortunately stuck using
	<strong>iTunes</strong> because apparently no one has made one decent music
	library application for that platform. On Linux, I use and love
	<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Lollypop"><strong>Lollypop</strong></a>.
