		I always love reading about how other people use their computers and
		desks.  Sites like <a href="https://usesthis.com/">UsesThis</a> and
		Simple Desks (R.I.P.) have taken many hours of my life, and I have
		taken inspiration from them many times. This page will serve as a
		perpetually-updated reference for how I'm currently using my computer.

<p>
	After several years and various laptops and operating systems, I have
	finally landed on a maxed-out <strong>Dell XPS 13 (9380)</strong>. It's
	plenty fast, thin and light, has a fantastic screen, great WiFi
	performance, and a rather comfortable keyboard with keys that actually
	move. It's a fair departure from my Thinkpad lineage, but I quite like it.
</p>

<p>
	At home, I use 2x <strong>Dell U2415 24" 1200p Monitors</strong> (on a dual
	monitor arm), a <strong>Filco Majestouch 2 Ninja</strong> mechanical
	keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches and an aftermarket set of PBT
	keycaps, and a <strong>Logitech MX Master</strong> (V1) mouse. Everything
	is plugged into a <strong>CalDigit TS3+ Thunderbolt Dock</strong> which
	allows me to live the "one cable" lifestyle, and I love it.
</p>

<p>
	At work, I have a standard-issue Macbook Pro, a standard-issue LG 4K monitor, a
	<a href="https://mechanicalkeyboards.com/shop/index.php?l=product_detail&p=3508"><strong>Varmilo Sakura TKL</strong></a>
	mechanical keyboard (also with Cherry MX Brown switches), and an
	<strong>Apple Magic Trackpad</strong>.
</p>

<h2>Software</h2>

<p>
	Probably the most accurate and detailed information about my software setup
	is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a> and
	<a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/bootstart">the Ansible playbooks</a>
	that I use to provision my workstations.
</p>

<p>
	For operating systems, I tend to stick to the latest <strong>Fedora
		Workstation</strong> release or I may also use the latest
	<strong>Ubuntu Desktop LTS</strong> depending on my mood or the machine's
	role. Of course, on my work Macbook I am stuck with macOS, unfortunately.
</p>

<p>
	I spend a significant amount of time in <strong>Firefox</strong> and
	<strong>vim</strong>. My shell of choice is
	<strong><code>zsh</code></strong> though for many years I used and still
	have a strong respect for <code>bash</code>. Depending on my mood, I might
	use <strong>Sublime Text 3</strong>, which continues to be an excellent
	text editor.
</p>

<p>
	I exclusively use a local music library, all of which I have purchased and
	built up over many years. On macOS I'm still unfortunately stuck using
	<strong><s>iTunes</s> Music.app</strong>because apparently no one has made
	one decent music library application for that platform. On Linux, I use
	<a href="https://wiki.gnome.org/Apps/Lollypop"><strong>Lollypop</strong></a>
	which works very well though I wish they would stop adding features.
