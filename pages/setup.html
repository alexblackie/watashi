  I'm always trying to find ways to improve my workstation. I love reading
  about and looking at other people's desks and workspaces, taking
  inspiration wherever I can. Hopefully this breakdown of my own helps others
  in the same way.

			<h2>Hardware</h2>

			<p>
				My "daily driver" computer is the <mark>Macbook Pro 14"</mark>
				(2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD). I've been a "Linux on the
				desktop" person for most of my life, but I was lured back to
				the Mac with the fantastic new hardware that came with the ARM
				transition.
			</p>

			<p>
				Centre-stage is an <mark>Apple Studio Display</mark> (27", 5k).
				I used to be a multi-monitor person, but I found it often
				harmed my ability to focus; dropping down to one monitor has
				helped tame distractions. The 5K resolution is also a welcome
				respite from the pixelated PC monitors of yore.
			</p>

			<p>
				For input, I use a <mark>ZSA Moonlander</mark> with
				after-market <mark>ZealPC Tealios</mark> switches. The typing
				experience on a split ortholinear keyboard is incredibly
				comfortable, and the Tealios make for insanely smooth key
				presses.
			</p>

			<p>
				For pointing, I use an <mark>Apple Magic Trackpad 2</mark>.
				Whenever I have used Macs, I have loved using Apple's wireless
				trackpads, going back to the first one in 2010. I do also have
				an original <mark>Logitech MX Master</mark> which I keep around
				mostly for games.
			</p>

			<p>
				For music listening, I have an <mark>Audient iD4</mark> audio
				interface and a pair of <mark>Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros</mark>
				(the 250&ohm; variant), and for speakers I've found the Apple
				Display's built-in ones to be perfectly sufficient.
				Additionally, I have a pair of <mark>Airpods Pro</mark> (2nd
				generation) which I use for listening to stuff around or out of
				the house.
			</p>

			<p>
				For meetings, screencasts, podcasts, or any other voice-related
				activity I have a <mark>Shure SM7B</mark> connected to the same
				Audient interface, albeit amplified by a <mark>Cloudlifter CL-1</mark>
				to get a bit more gain headroom. It's shock-mounted to a
				generic Blue microphone arm.

				<h2>Software</h2>

				<p>
					Probably the best resource for the details on my software
					setup is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
					and <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/setup">the Ansible playbooks</a>
					that set up all my machines.
				</p>

				<p>
					For getting work done, I primarily use <mark>Firefox</mark>
					or <mark>Safari</mark> for web-based things, <mark>neovim</mark>
					for text editing, <mark>kitty</mark> for terminal
					emulation, <mark>Docker</mark> for containing,
					<mark>Obsidian</mark> for note-taking, and
					<mark>Todoist</mark> for managing my life with lists. I use
					the standard Apple apps for Mail and Calendar.
				</p>

				<p>
					I maintain my own music library which I host with
					with <mark>Plex</mark>, and access with
					<mark>Plexamp</mark> on macOS and <mark>Prism</mark> on
					iOS. The experience is better than any streaming service, I
					get to keep my obscure music, and can directly support
					artists by buying their albums.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cloud infrastructure is generally on
					<mark>Microsoft Azure</mark> with some secondary stuff on
					<mark>Linode</mark> and <mark>OVH</mark>. Cloud
					resources are automated with <mark>Terraform</mark>, and
					non-Kubernetes servers are configured using
					<mark>Ansible</mark> playbooks.
				</p>

				<p>
					For myself and my family I run or manage a few services,
					including <mark>Nextcloud</mark> for file syncing and
					storage, <mark>Fastmail</mark> for email and workgroups,
					<mark>Tailscale</mark> for a mesh VPN and secure traffic
					tunneling, and <mark>Azure AD</mark> for secure
					identity management and SSO.
				</p>

				<h2>Furniture</h2>

				<p>
					My desk is a near-death <mark>Ikea Bekant</mark> motorised
					sit/stand model. It barely survived moving across the
					country and is literally falling apart. It's still sturdy
					enough for now, and gets the job done.
				</p>

				<p>
					For sitting, I have a "fully loaded" <mark>Herman Miller Mirra 2</mark>
					chair. It is incredibly comfortable, perhaps <em>too</em>
					comfortable as I often forget to stand during the day.
