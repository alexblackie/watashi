    <h1>The Little Mavericks That Could</h1>
  </header>

  <article>
    <p>
      I jumped on the OSX 10.9 upgrade bandwagon sooner than I had originally
      intended. I am constantly switching operating systems, so my curiosity
      (and endless restore points) got the best of me, and I jumped in
      head-first. I was not disappointed.
    </p>

    <p>
      When Mavericks was announced back in June, it ignited a spark of hope
      deep inside of me. After Lion, I lost all respect for OSX, and got to the
      point of not owning a single Apple product; I abandoned ship,
      so-to-speak.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, with Mavericks, Apple promised improvements to the–wait for
      it–<em>kernel</em>. Along with iBooks, Maps, and a bunch of other garbage
      came one of the best decisions Apple has ever made: focus on the kernel.
    </p>

    <p>
      I love the fact OSX is based on BSD. It could be one of the most redeeming
      features about it, along with the UI/UX. However, the Mach kernel is old,
      and God knows how long Apple has let it stagnate. I think some of the
      improvements they made for iOS (as iOS runs an ARM port of Mach) have
      finally made their way back to mainline: power savings, sandboxing, memory
      compression… All of these features make sense in a mobile context, and I
      bet that's where they were birthed.
    </p>

    <p>
      I began using OSX during the Snow Leopard days, and I can say, with
      confidence, that Snow Leopard was one of the best computing experiences I
      have had to-date.  Lion and Mountain Lion never lived up to the polish
      and stability of Snow Leopard. I am not alone on this: I know a few
      people who are still on Snow Leopard because they were disheartened with
      the "improvements" of 10.7-onwards.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, Mavericks changes this. For the first time since I turned on my
      first iMac, I truly <em>enjoy</em> using OSX. I've used it full time
      (even on my desktop at home) for pretty much everything, except gaming,
      and I love it.  The improvements they've made are truly just that:
      improvements. Unlike Lion, the improvements in Mavericks are worthwhile
      and add to the experience.
    </p>

    <p>
      The only complaint I can muster is the bloat, but that has been a
      complaint of mine for eternity. I don't want iBooks, Maps, Mail,
      Messages, iTunes, Reminders, Notes, etc. If there was a "developer" spin
      of OSX where I could get the core OS, Safari, and the Utilities folder, I
      would be perfectly content.

      Apple is taking a step in the right direction. They stumbled with Lion,
      and fell on their face in Mountain Lion, but now they're starting to pick
      themselves up.
    </p>

    <p>
      I hope Mavericks is a sign of what's to come in OSX: stability and
      polish. Those two things are what made Snow Leopard the best release of
      OSX, and perhaps it is those two things that will cause 10.10 to be
      regarded just as highly.
    </p>

    <p>
      In conclusion, <strong>I like Mavericks a lot</strong>. I think it is one
      of the best releases of OSX I have used, and I have committed to using it
      full-time. I really hope this re-kindled respect for Apple doesn't fall
      flat…
