      Yesterday I converted my entire music library back to 320kHz MP3. And
      since then, I have nearly forgotten. The difference in audio quality is
      so miniscule that I have not once noticed. Not to mention I've saved
      nearly 40GB of hard drive space in the process.
    </p>

    <p>
      I fell into a trap a few months ago when I discovered FLAC. I thought I
      was missing something because all of this music I was listening to was
      only mere M4A- or MP3-encoded — I thought, "I must be missing so much
      detail in my music."
    </p>

    <p>tl;dr: Not really.</p>

    <p>
      I listen to a wide range of music, from Jazz, to Electronic, to brutal
      death metal. I listen to all of it on either my Sennheiser HD 280 Pros at
      home, my Shure SRH440s at work, or my Sennheiser earbuds (of which the
      model escapes me; they're bass-heavy and terrible). I have by no means a
      "fancy" audio setup – at home I have an AudioEngine DAC, but it is rarely
      used. Most of the time I settle with the built-in audio of my Macbook.
    </p>

    <p>
      But, even at inappropriately-loud volumes and piped through my DAC, I
      could barely discern any difference between 320kHz MP3 and WAV files I
      downloaded directly from the artist. Notice my careful use of the word
      "barely" – I <em>could</em>, at times, correctly identify which format
      was which, but I had to listen very closely to a song I know quite well.
    </p>

      <strong>When does the cost outweigh the benefits</strong>? When every
      album you add to your collection weighs a hefty average of approximately
      one to two gigabytes, it compounds quite quickly. My conservative music
      collection was about 50GB, and that was still with half of it left as MP3
      or M4A (as I was too cheap to re-buy it in lossless). This caused quite a
      problem with the majority of my computers having only a 128GB SSD. I
      found myself relying more and more on my external hard drive, which was
      slow to spool and unreliable. And it meant that if I wanted to work
      somewhere, I would have to tote my external hard drive along with my
      laptop just so I could listen to music while I worked.
    </p>

    <p>
      The biggest problem I ran into was simply the lack of  avenues through
      which to legally obtain lossless versions of albums. In a roundabout way,
      I suppose the search for lossless pushed me away from "mainstream" music,
      and towards the plethora of indie music on Bandcamp, whose service
      requires the artists upload lossless versions of songs. But for more
      "mainstream" artists, I was forced to purchase physical media and rip it
      in order to satisfy my lossless needs. My CD drawer in the organizer
      beside my desk at home is now full of CDs that I have read once and then
      stored indefinitely.
    </p>

    <p>
      To add to the inconvenience, some players couldn't handle the 96k FLAC
      files, and would often skip like a CD Walkman. There is also quite a lack
      of simple audio library managers out there – most are trying to
      "redefine" music players, when really all I want is a list of songs and
      FLAC support… Eventually I settled on <a
      href="http://www.enqueueapp.com">Enqueue</a> which performed quite well
      overall, save a couple odd UI quirks and bugs.
    </p>

    <p>
      However, I still love the idea of lossless audio.  I just do not love the
      pains that come with storing large quantities of it for personal
      listening. For regular, every-day listening, or background music while I
      work, FLAC is completely unnecessary. It takes up a tonne of hard drive
      space, breaks some music players (or simply isn't supported by
      others)…for nothing except a tiny bit more quality that, to me at least,
      presents little to no difference in listening experience–certainly not
      enough difference to justify the inconvenience of purchasing, storing,
      and playing lossless audio.
