      I am a Canadian. That means I have to put up with the monstrosity that is
      the CRTC (the regulating body for TV, Radio, and Internet in Canada). We
      are burdened with a government in Canada that wants to monitor and
      control everything we do on the Internet. Sounds a lot like the Communist
      Party of China, does it not?
    </p>

    <p>
      For a supposedly “free country”, Canada seems to be turning against its
      citizens. The CRTC is behind our peril. Their passé goal of “preserving
      Canadian culture” is absolutely unnecessary in the technology age. The
      CRTC is trying to keep up, but all they’re doing is trying to regulate
      and control something they have no clue how to use. I bet you most of the
      CRTC board members don’t even have internet in their homes; if they do,
      it’s probably a 56K modem hooked up to their Compaq Deskpro so they can
      check their email in Eudora.

      <strong>The fact is: if something is of crappy quality, being Canadian
      doesn’t make it any better</strong>. People still won’t listen to or
      watch something of low quality, regardless of its origin. Where it came
      from, or who made it is completely irrelevant. Just because something’s
      Canadian doesn’t mean it has to be shoved down our throats. With the
      global community that is the internet, there isn’t a need to “preserve
      culture”; the internet is its own culture.
    </p>

    <p>
      Canadian literary authors are successful and well-respected in their
      field, and they are not regulated by a governing body. Music and
      television, however, are regulated, and rarely produce anything of
      significant quality; or the vast majority of Canadian talent ends up in
      the United States anyway. The simple truth is, talent is not constrained
      by geographical boundaries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Almost every person in Canada has an internet connection. This means if
      they want to find Canadian content, they can go to <a
      href="http://google.ca/">a</a> <a href="http://yahoo.ca/">search</a> <a
      href="http://bing.com/">engine</a> and search for “Canada”. I get about 3
      billion results, and guess what? The CRTC didn’t have anything to do with
      my finding of Canadian content. If anything, their ridiculously broken
      laws on net neutrality are hindering my finding of this content.
    </p>

    <p>
      So, <strong>admit your defeat, CRTC</strong>. If you stepped out of your
      fantasy world and opened your eyes, you’d see Canadians sharing and
      creating Canadian content without your help. Yes, that’s right,
      <strong>you are not needed anymore</strong>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Step down, give up, say goodbye, and just let us use the tool you’re
      failing to understand. If you can’t keep up, you’re useless to us.
      Dismantling yourself would help Canadian culture, and wasn’t that your
      goal in the first place?
