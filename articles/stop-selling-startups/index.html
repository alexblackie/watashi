the recent news of Adobe consuming its staunchest rival, Figma</a>, I am
once again left in shock and awe at the truly short-sighted and
innovation-destroying nature of the modern startup economy.</big></p>
<p>I have struggled to come to terms with the death of startup-led
disruption in recent times. A startup is a risk, an idea, and a fresh
perspective; a startup is the free market working correctly in pushing
innovation forward and preventing stagnation.</p>
<p>We live in an era saturated with startups in practically every
market, and yet we still suffer through ever-increasing monopolisation
and fairly extreme stagnation in most business-adjacent technology. Why?
How? What has taken us here?</p>
<p>Short-sighted greed.</p>
<p>Take a look at Figma: they were <em>crushing</em> the market. Big
tech, small tech, indepedent designers – Figma was an unmitigated force
in the design industry, finally providing a cross-platform and powerful
answer to a market largely dominated by a stagnant incumbent: Adobe.</p>
<p>But when Adobe knocks on your door with a wheelbarrow full of cash,
it’s seen as an “opportunity.” What opportunity would that be? What sort
of “opportunity” is it to <em>give up</em> when you’re winning?</p>
<p>A wheelbarrow full of cash, especially in the arms of an enemy, is an
admission of defeat – an act of desperation. If someone offers you
<em>twenty billion US dollars</em> for your company, it means you are
worth <strong>multiples</strong> of that sum. It means someone,
somewhere, did a calculation and figured out that USD\$20B was an
acceptable short-term loss. They’re thinking of the long term, why
aren’t you?</p>
<p>Five years from now, would anyone have though of Adobe® Photoshop® or
Adobe® XD® when they needed to mock up a new UI project? Absolutely not.
They would have reached for Figma.</p>
<p>Figma could have become a multi-billion dollar independent company,
and dominated the market, but they instead chose suicide by
acquisiton.</p>
<p>The key point everyone should take from Figma’s untimely demise in
the hands of its competitor: you’re worth significantly more than some
fearful executive can pen in a deal; they told you as much by offering
to acquire you.</p>
<p>A wheelbarrow of cash isn’t an “opportunity,” it’s confirmation that
your idea has merit and can succeed far beyond where it is today.</p>
<p>Don’t sell your startup.</p>
<p>Especially you, Sketch.</p>
