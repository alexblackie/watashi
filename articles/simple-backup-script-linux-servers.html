<p>I administer a local development server. I use it to practice my Unix terminal kung-fu, as well as develop some local intranet web applications. I&#8217;ve learned a lot from the old box. I&#8217;ve written a small bash script that I use to generate a backup of certain directories and compress it as a tarball.</p>

<h3>The Code</h3>

<p>Let&#8217;s start off with the final source code&#8230;</p>

```bash
THE_DATE=`date "+%Y-%m-%d"`
cd /var/backups
mkdir $THE_DATE
cd $THE_DATE
tar cvzf latest_backup.tar.gz -C / var/www home/alex etc usr/bin
```

<h3>Pre-run checks</h3>

<p>
    First, make sure there is a directory <code>/var/backups</code>. It
    doesn&#8217;t matter if it already exists, just as long as
    it&#8217;s there. Also, make sure you can run this program as
    root.
</p>

<h3>Setting it up</h3>

<p>
    Make a new file in <code>/usr/bin</code>, name it whatever you want
    (I call mine <code>wwwbackup</code>). The content of that file is
    the source code above.
</p>

<p>Save the file, then on the command line, run this command:</p>

<pre>sudo chmod +x /usr/bin/yourfilename</pre>

<p>That command will make the file executable by the system.</p>

<h3>Configuring</h3>

<p>
    The only line you&#8217;re going to want to change is the last line.
    At the end there are a few directory paths, these are the
    directories to be included in the backup. Each directory is
    separated by a space. Make sure you <strong>leave the first / and
    the space after it.</strong>
</p>

<p>For example, if I wanted to only backup <code>/var/www</code> the last line would read:</p>

<pre>tar cvzf latest_backup.tar.gz -C / var/www</pre>

<h3>Running It</h3>

<p>You can run the program by typing <code>sudo wwwbackup</code> (where <code>wwwbackup</code> is the name of your file).</p>

<p>
    If all goes well, you&#8217;ll see a list of all the files in the
    directories you set backing up. The script will create a folder with the
    current day&#8217;s date and place a tarball under that folder with your
    backup contents.
</p>

<p>
    If you don&#8217;t want the script to list all of the files
    it&#8217;s backing up, remove the letter v from the last line. So it
    would start like: <code>tar czf</code>.
