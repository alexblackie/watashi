  title: Build Worse Software
  description: >
    I've gone from being a teenager building WordPress sites to a professional
    software developer. But I've forgotten how to build software. It's time to
    get worse.

    <big>
        One of my first software projects -- probably the first project
        I did that wasn't just building a website theme -- was building
        my own CMS. The year was 2010, I was a middle school student
        doing web design on the side, and I was tired of
        WordPress.
    </big>
</p>

<p>
    I am reminded of this project from time to time; usually I remember how
    much I enjoyed building it. I used this custom CMS for some local business
    websites during my consulting days. The project was just a pile of
    procedural PHP scripts, with HTML and PHP just smashed together. MySQL was
    the database of choice, with unprepared SQL strings littered everywhere.
</p>

<p>
    Somewhere along the way since then, I learned the "right" way to build
    things: carefully, with lots of planning, tests-first, deployed in a
    scalable way, stateless if possible&hellip; the list goes on. And with that
    knowledge, I lost the ability to just <em>build something</em>. My first
    question wasn't "What features should it have?", but rather "What tools and
    architecture should I choose?".
</p>

<p>
    In my path to becoming a "professional programmer" <mark>I lost the most
        important goal of writing software: to solve problems</mark>. I became
    enamoured with the tools, processes, and dogmatic "correctness" of various
    communities that I blinded myself to what I was actually trying to
    accomplish.
</p>

<p>
    My projects languished in various states of incompleteness as every time I
    would try and make progress, I would be hindered by a crippling narrative
    that I needed to do it <em>the right way</em>. I was paralyzed by my own
    irrational standards.
</p>

<p>
    <mark>My solution to this was to build worse software.</mark> All the
    barriers of code quality, tests, flawless architecture -- they're are all
    constructs that affect <em>production</em> software; but they do not affect
    software that's just getting started. I had to unlearn my impulses and
    force myself to take na√Øve risks and shortcuts to getting a working
    solution. Visible progress is the finest motivator.
</p>

<p>
    Since then I've made an effort to purposefully write bad software first,
    and good software later. By prototyping a messy, mostly-working version of
    something, you explore the solution organically and have a starting point
    for improvement.
</p>

<p>
    This practice of care-free prototyping is what has allowed me to build
    <a href="https://www.zaiko.xyz">Zaiko</a>, my inventory management
    software. I needed to track server parts as I built and shipped some
    machines to a datacenter, maybe 4 or 5 years ago. None of the existing
    solutions seemed particularly nice to use, so I started building my own.
</p>

<p>
    I could have spent decades planning, scheming, and architecting a
    textbook-worthy application that followed all the rules; instead, <mark>I
        slapped together a Rails application that worked "enough"</mark> and
    solved my problem.  Five years and one rewrite in Elixir later, I
    understand so much more about what I want from the product and have slowly
    built up a production-ready SaaS application that is ready to scale and
    extend, and has pretty decent test coverage.
</p>

<p>
    Was that Rails prototype a waste of time, since I rewrote it? Absolutely
    not. It let me quickly explore features and ideas, and got me using my own
    product as soon as possible. Would I have felt comfortable opening it up to
    the world? Also absolutely not. The goal isn't to build worse software and
    call it done; the goal is to build worse software so you get the context
    you need to evolve it into good software over time.
</p>

<p>
    If I had to sum up the lesson I learned in a sentence, it'd be&hellip; Time
    heals all software? You have to build the village before the roads?
    Something like that, anyway; I'm still working on it.

    <strong>Addendum:</strong> A while back I found a snapshot of the code for
    my first CMS archived on Google Code (RIP). I managed to export the SVN
    repo into Git and have
    <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/x96-panel">archived the project on Github</a>
    for those who are curious to see some godawful PHP.  Only took a few
    seconds to find an SQL injection vulnerability. Oh, how times change.
