    <p class="intro">
      I recently purchased a Topre Realforce keyboard. It was a considerable
      investment which I justified through brief but first-hand experience. I
      had known about Topre keyboards for a while, even owning the low-end
      <a href="http://www.coolermaster.com/peripheral/keyboards/novatouchtkl/">CoolerMaster Novatouch</a>
      for a time. [Ultimately, the Novatouch's switches didn't feel that
      spectacular, and I happily returned to my Cherry MX Browns.] My
      perspectives were changed forever, however, once I tried a friend's
      weighted Realforce.
    </p>

    <p>
      I was pointed to <a href="http://elitekeyboards.com/">EliteKeyboards</a>
      by the same friend, who had noticed my beloved beige-coloured model was
      back in-stock. I completed the purchase just a couple minutes afterwards.
      I anxiously awaited the Canada Post delivery person for just over a week,
      and finally my baby arrived.
    </p>

    <p>
      At the time of writing, I have been heavily using the keyboard for nearly
      two weeks. I have written thousands of words of English prose, and an
      even greater amount of code. For the first few days of ownership, I
      didn't want to stop typing. As you can perhaps assume from this blog
      post, I <em>still</em> don't want to stop typing.
    </p>

    <hr>

    <p>
      I feel I must at least mention the beige. I haven't had a beige computer
      or computer peripheral since my first computer&mdash;a Compaq Deskpro
      running Windows 98. A wonderful machine in its beige-painted steel
      enclosure, supporting a beige 14" CRT monitor, attached to a beige
      keyboard itself beside a beige mouse. I look around my desk now
      and all I see is black-on-black-on-black&hellip;
    </p>

    <p>
      In white, beige, or other colours, peripherals have character. I miss the
      days when my desk had character. Now it's just a pile of drab black
      squares.
    </p>

    <p>
      Therefore, I was very excited when ordering this keyboard to finally be
      able to own something manufactured present-day in beige. It is stark
      amongst my otherwise black-themed desk and I <em>love</em> it.

      <p class="intro">
        The most important aspect of a keyboard is how it feels to use. For a
        keyboard at this pricepoint, the expectations are naturally set quite
        high.  Topre really delivers, however, and even having tried one
        before, I was still taken by the feeling of the keyboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        Each keypress starts with a sharp drop, as the high-placed bump forces
        you to bottom out every time. This crisp, high bump is met with a nice
        soft landing however, so it doesn't feel harsh. With the release, the
        key springs immediately back up with you, making a satisfying
        muddy-sounding pop as it reaches its initial position. The combination
        of softness, springy response, and crisp actuation makes for an
        extremely comfortable and satisfying switch.
      </p>

      <p>
        Not only do the switches feel great, but they're <em>individually</em>
        weighted to account for your weaker fingers. Your pinky finger likely
        isn't as strong as your index finger, and so the keys get gradually
        lighter towards the edges of the keyboard. Additionally, the
        non-alphanumeric keys are <em>even heavier</em>, which gives them a
        very "chunky" feeling; even more satisfying and crisp than the normal
        keys.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using my previous keyboard with Cherry MX Brown switches, they feel
        almost linear in comparison. The bump is significantly less pronounced
        than Topre switches, and the harsh bottoming-out feels painful (though
        that could likely be solved with some O-rings).
      </p>

      <p>
        Interestingly, I have a new appreciation for my Thinkpad's keyboard
        after experiencing Topre switches. The Thinkpad keyboards manage to
        maintain a similarly-satisfying bump, and transitioning between my
        laptop and my Realforce isn't a jarring experience. I do have to credit
        IBM &amp; Lenovo for their fantastic keyboards; I always loved my
        Thinkpad keyboard, and now I know why. It's essentially just a
        shallower, not quite as springy version of a Topre switch.

        There is only one thing I dislike about this keyboard. It is
        <strong>huge</strong>.
      </p>

      <p>
        This thing is a whale posing as a HID. The huge forehead is seemingly
        without purpose, the numpad is a feature I have learned to forget, and
        it has a surprising weight.
      </p>

      <p>
        Luckily, I don't carry it around with me so the weight is not an issue;
        I mostly live in the Terminal so mouse distance isn't a huge problem;
        and my desk is not want for space so the large footprint doesn't cause
        any headaches.
      </p>

      <p>
        In other words, my only issues with this keyboard are superficial.

        I couldn't be happier with this keyboard. Its typing experience is far
        above anything else I have used, and its beige strikes a wonderful
        aesthetic contrast in the standard dark colourscheme of modern
        technology.
      </p>

      <p>
        Its price leaves the wallet bruised and beaten, but I can't see myself
        coming to regret purchasing this keyboard any time soon. It may cost
        twice as much as my previous keyboard, but I would consider it twice as
        enjoyable to use. I haven't enjoyed typing this much since getting my
        first mechanical keyboard all those years ago.
      </p>

      <hr>

      <p>
        After all that, <strong>would I recommend this keyboard?</strong> The
        answer is: <em>maybe</em>. I adore mine, but its hefty price tag means
        it's not something most people will impulse-buy just to try out. I
        would recommend making friends with someone who owns one to try it
        first, or diving in blind only if you have the cash to spend and are
        dissatisfied with your current keyboard.
      </p>

      <p>
        I may even recommend trying "mainstream" mechanical keyboards first, if
        you haven't. A lot of people settle on Cherry MX switches and never
        have any reason to go elsewhere.
      </p>

      <p>
        I <em>absolutely do not</em> recommend getting "cheap" Topre keyboards
        either. The CoolerMaster NovaTouch, and even Topre's own TypeHeaven are
        simply not comparable to the experience of the Realforce.
