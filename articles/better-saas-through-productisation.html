    SaaS codebases can get messy and tightly-coupled to their dependencies.
    Learn how to avoid this by thinking about them differently.

<section id="intro">
    <p><big>
        In the world of private codebases, and especially SaaS, you can easily
        fall into the trap of thinking, "well, it's OK because no one is going
        to see this." A mindset like that can wreck a codebase, and can fuel
        micro-decisions that lead to painful long-term mistakes.
    </big></p>

    <p>
        First, regarding "productisation," <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/w/index.php?title=productization&oldid=51827427">Wiktionary</a> defines it as
    </p>

    <blockquote>
        The act of modifying something, such as a concept or a tool internal to
        an organization, to make it suitable as a commercial product.
    </blockquote>

    <p>
        To put it another way, I find it very helpful to frame things from the
        perspective of "what if someone else had to run this software?" This is
        obviously something that open source projects have to think about quite
        a bit, so you could also frame it as "what if this was open source?"
    </p>

    <p>
        There are many facets to this, but I want to dive into just two:
        <mark>reproducibility</mark> and <mark>portability</mark>. These
        concepts frequently come up in conversations around package managers
        and software releases, but they are also quite pertinent to SaaS.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="reproducibility">
    <h2>Reproducibility: I should be able to run the thing.</h2>

    <aside class="aside">
        <p>
            Note: this is not referring to "reproducibility" in terms of
            package integrity, Ã  la <a href="https://reproducible-builds.org/">reproducible builds</a>.
            I love that project and its efforts, but I am talking about
            something else here.
        </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
        A while back, I was charged with spinning up a validation environment
        for a SaaS product to provide a "safe" place for a QA team to mess
        around with upcoming features. The goal was to have this sit somewhere
        in between our "staging" environment, which was often quite buggy and
        more for internal developers, and production, which we needed to keep
        as stable as possible for customers.
    </p>

    <p>
        "Simple enough." I said. Surely, we already have a couple other
        environments, we can just add one more! The problem was that no one had
        spun up a new environment for <em>several years</em>, and everyone
        involved in doing so had long since left the company.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the end, the new "QA" environment never fully worked. It
        <em>mostly</em> worked, but several components would fail to integrate
        or would mysteriously break in ways no one really understood. We tried
        to copy production as close as we could, and still we failed to
        replicate it.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is what I mean by reproducibility: <mark>anyone should be able to
            run the software you make</mark>. A production environment
        shouldn't be an elusive, one-off occurence; you should be able to
        recreate production, and the steps should be obvious.
    </p>

    <p>
        This naturally leads into discussions about "DevOps" and
        "Infrastructure as Code," both of which are definitely a key part of
        the solution to this. Being able to understand and replicate
        infrastructure based on playbooks or manifests solves a huge part of
        the problem. But it's not the whole story.
    </p>

    <p>
        Even with a fully-automated cloud, there will always be some manual
        work, keys to rotate, service integrations to set up, etc. These
        service dependencies have to be documented and fail safely.
    </p>

    <p>
        In a SaaS world, it's incredibly easy to add a new service
        dependency--for this case, let's use a hypothetical geocoding API--add
        the keys to production, and never think about it again. By applying a
        product focus, it becomes clearer that this dependency should be
        optional, should be documented, and should fail gracefully.
    </p>

    <p>
        These sorts of third-party dependencies hold their own configuration,
        and often that configuration is difficult to export or automate. Do
        certain options need to be enabled for your application? Do certain
        addons need to be active? These are all questions that should have
        documented and discoverable answers -- in code or otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
        Additionally, external service dependencies should be resilient against
        missing configuration. Configuration should be validated and warnings
        should exist; and if a service is not critical to the operation of the
        application, it shouldn't block the rest of the app just because it's
        unconfigured.
    </p>

    <p>
        This level of "configuration resiliency" helps during development, as devs
        don't need to get 1000 test API keys just to boot a console; and,
        additionally, helps you build better software overall. By baking in
        resiliency, you make your app more flexible in the face of failure,
        where you <em>know</em> that you can disable many parts of it and it
        won't break the entire experience.
    </p>

    <p>
        In essence, <mark>you should be the downstream and the upstream</mark>;
        you should both develop the software, but also treat yourself as a
        consumer of it. Don't take shortcuts to production just because you own
        the whole pipeline.
    </p>

    <p>
        This makes it easier to deploy multiple versions of your service
        -- whether that means on-premises for a large enterprise customer, or
        in a different geographic region for compliance purposes. Ensuring your
        codebase is resilient and reproducible could be a business-value
        feature!
    </p>

<section id="portability">
    <h2>Portability: hedge against your integrations.</h2>

    <p>
        Being able to replicate, say, a bunch of AWS service configuration is
        powerful, but it still leaves you tightly-coupled to AWS. That doesn't
        help much if we want to replicate production in an on-premises
        environment, or even locally on a laptop.
    </p>

    <p>
        Just as building software to be resilient against missing or invalid
        dependencies, it can be even more advantageous to take it a step
        further, and make your software resilient <em>across vendors</em>.
    </p>

    <p>
        This is not a new concept; really, all this means is <mark>build the
            right abstractions</mark>. Don't leak third-party libraries around
        your codebase, and build your interfaces with interchangeable backend
        implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, integrating object storage is a very common thing to
        sprinkle across your codebase. Building a proper entrypoint and
        abstraction around it will allow you to swap out the backing
        implementation without having to modify your application.
    </p>

    <p>
        In the object storage example, something like Rails'
        <code>ActiveStorage</code> is a great example of this abstraction.
        Depending on the environment and requirements, you can swap out backing
        storage, be it on-disk, to cloud, etc. Your code calls a standard API,
        and doesn't need to change to support a variety of implementations.
    </p>

    <p>
        These sort of abstractions can facilitate portability, allowing you to
        run your service almost anywhere, with any technology you can build an
        implementation for. Does an enterprise customer need to store file
        uploads on a SAN instead of object storage? Is AWS down and you need to
        migrate production workloads to a DR site on a different provider? All
        of this can be yours, for the low-low price of strong abstractions.
    </p>

    <p>
        However, as with everything, <mark>you need to ensure you don't go too
            far</mark>; you must weigh your dependencies versus any downsides
        of abstraction.
    </p>

    <p>
        For example, heavy abstractions on top of a database (such as
        PostgreSQL) can add more trouble than they're worth, and have
        performance impacts compared to a more optimized, direct
        implementation. For these, the focus should shift from abstractions, to
        choosing the right APIs for your application.
    </p>
</section>

<section id="standardapis">
    <h2>Portability, the sequel: standards are good, actually</h2>

    <p>
        For cases where making your own standard interface for dependencies is
        not worth it or not possible, using standardized APIs is the next best
        thing.
    </p>

    <p>
        Take the aforementioned database example; there can be great benefits
        in performance to optimise your usage of a database to take advantage
        of a specific implementation. What matters in this case is the
        technology you choose.
    </p>

    <aside class="aside">
        <p>
            I make a lot of comparisons to fancy cloud database offerings in
            this section, but perhaps it's worth disclaiming that I have not
            actually used any of these first hand. I'm a Postgres man, forever
            and always.
        </p>
    </aside>

    <p>
        You can still achieve portability and resiliency through non-abstracted
        choices, as long as those choices are either open or standardized. In
        the database example, you can spin up a PostgreSQL server anywhere,
        even on your own hardware. There isn't much that is stopping you from
        moving providers or running in other environments.
    </p>

    <p>
        For an opposite example: Google Spanner on GCP, or AWS's DynamoDB.
        While both are very powerful technologies, they are unique to their
        respective clouds and use non-standard APIs. You cannot move to another
        cloud without significantly changing your application.
    </p>

    <p>
        To be clear, this isn't a dig on "the cloud" -- this is a dig on vendor
        lock-in. Where Google's Spanner invented their own interface, Microsoft
        Azure's CosmosDB gives the consumer the option of various different
        standard APIs, including SQL- or MongoDB-compatible endpoints. This is
        a great win by combining a standard API (one that means a developer can
        run a different MongoDB-like service locally) with the power of an
        integrated and globally-scalable cloud solution in production.
    </p>

<section id="conclusion">
    <h2>Productisation doesn't mean open source</h2>

    <p>
        While I think it helps with the thought process to ask "what if this
        was open source?", that doesn't mean you have to become open source to
        get the benefits of that mindset. In my experience, just being aware of
        the codebase you are building, and keeping future generations in mind,
        is enough to hopefully put you on the right paths.
    </p>

    <p>
        Hopefully product-focused thinking can help you clean up your codebases
        as well.
