  I've always been a fan of laptops. I love having the ability to pick up my
  computer and go work somewhere else for a while without interrupting my
  workflow and without having to sync files between a laptop and desktop.
  Right now my daily-driver is a 15" Thinkpad T530: it's large, thick, and
  heavy, but it's a wonderful desktop-replacement and I love it for
  everything but its size.
</p>

<p>
  Due to the hulking nature of my primary laptop, I wanted something super
  light and (preferrably) cheap to take to coffee shops, meetups, etc. –
  places that weren't as accomodating to a 15" beast of a workstation. I
  scoured the internet, falling on many perfect-sounding products (like the
  HP Stream) that simply <em>are not</em>, at the time of writing, available
  to purchase in Canada.  Eventually I found myself on Microsoft's online
  store, and minutes later I had ordered one of the 11" Asus notebooks
  (netbook?). All told, the order came to a whopping \$200 (after tax and
  shipping costs).

<h3 id="the-packaging">The Packaging</h3>

<p>Let's start with something trivial and boring: the box.</p>

<figure>
  <img src="box.jpg" alt="The Box">
</figure>

<p>
  The packaging is all cardboard, and quite eco-friendly (except for the
  styrofoam pouch wrapping the computer itself). +10 environment points for
  Asus.
</p>

<p>
  The box design is covered in "IN SEARCH OF INCREDIBLE", which are
  definitely English words but I still don't think it actually means
  anything.
</p>

<h3 id="the-hardware">The Hardware</h3>

<p>
  For a \$170 computer, I had zero expectations. I have used low-end PC
  laptops before, so I sort of assumed it would be creaky, bendy, and nearly
  impossible to use without feeling gross.
</p>

<p>Simply put, I was wrong.</p>

<h4 id="the-keyboard">The Keyboard</h4>

<p>
  I want to start with what is probably the highlight of this machine: the
  keyboard. The chicklet-style keys have a moderate travel distance, a
  slightly textured feel, and a very satisfying crispness. To boot, there is
  absolutely no bend to the keyboard at all – it is extremely solid.
</p>

<p>
  Only a couple keys got shafted: the escape and tilde keys are both
  half-width, but that's acceptible on such a tiny form-factor, and for
  generally under-used keys. Otherwise, the keyboard feels full-size (or
  damn-well close to it) and I have had no trouble typing this entire review
  using it.
</p>

<h4 id="the-body">The Body</h4>

<p>
  The body on this machine is totally solid. I can't seem to find any points
  of flex, nor any creaky or cheap-feeling plastic. The entire exterior is a
  type of soft-touch plastic that feels wonderful to the touch.
</p>

<p>
  The lid has a bit of wobble if you tap it, but only slightly more than my
  Thinkpad. There is a single pressure-point that produces visible
  distortions on the display if you close the lid with one hand, but nothing
  I would worry about.
</p>

<h4 id="the-size">The Size</h4>

<p>
  This is one of the smallest and thinnest laptops I've used. It's not quite
  Macbook Air-thin, but it's close. For comparison, here it is beside my 2014
  Retina Macbook Pro.
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="height-open.jpg" alt="Height comparison with Macbook while open">
</figure>

<p>
  If Apple made an 11" Retina Macbook Pro, this would match its physical size
  almost exactly.
</p>

<p>
  However, its similarities with the Retina Macbook Pro end with the
  dimensions.
</p>

<h4 id="the-screen">The Screen</h4>

<p>
  The screen is a 1366x768 TN panel with a glossy finish. Personally, I dislike
  all of these things. That said, the TN panel is one of the better ones, with
  adequate viewing angles and surprisingly good colours (most likely due to the
  Asus Splendid utility that comes pre-installed). The resolution is also
  acceptible because at 11", the screen has a DPI that actually makes that
  resolution perfect. The glossiness I can get over (I've used Apple products for
  long enough to ignore it), but I still would prefer a matte version.
</p>

<p>
  Overall, it's a <em>good</em> screen. It's not great, but for a \$170
  computer, it's pretty good.
</p>

<h4 id="the-trackpad">The Trackpad</h4>

<p>
  The trackpad is another strong point of this laptop. I'd even venture to say
  it's one of the best PC trackpads I've used. It is accurate, smooth, large, has
  a satisfying click, and is multi-touch. There are not separate click buttons,
  which could be annoying for some people, but I found myself clicking with my
  other hand, resting my finger on the bottom left, and it worked fine.
</p>

<p>
  The included Asus gesture-enhancing driver does wonders; two-finger smooth
  scrolling works great, edge-swiping to get to charms works great, tap-to-click
  works great&hellip;
</p>

<p>
  Really, I have no complaints. It works and it works well. It's actually better
  than the one on my Thinkpad.
</p>

<h4 id="the-webcam">The Webcam</h4>

<p>
  This thing has a webcam. It's blurry, grainy, slow, and 480p. It is terrible.
</p>

<h4 id="the-audio">The Audio</h4>

<p>
  The on-board audio is also surprisingly not bad. If you usually use
  on-board audio, you probably will be totally happy with it. If you're on
  the go and need to listen to music, it'll accomodate. From a couple
  listening tests with different pairs of headphones, it outputs a fairly
  balanced and clear sound, if lacking a bit in the low-mid-range. It drives
  my Sennheiser HD280 Pros without a problem, even at (dangerously) high
  volumes. I could push it all the way to 100 without any distortion or
  quality loss. Dance music is punchy and crisp; speed metal maintains its
  definition and doesn't get lost in a white-noise mess; acoustic guitar and
  acapella sound very clear and clean&hellip;
</p>

<p>
  Obviously plugging in an external DAC will always be a better choice, but
  if you're too lazy, too cheap, or too far away the on-board audio does a
  satisfactory job.
</p>

<p>
  I would mention what the chip is, but I can't seem to be able to find out.
  Both <a href="https://www.piriform.com/speccy">Speccy</a> and Windows Device
  Manager report it as an "Intel SST Audio Device", but there is a pre-installed
  "Realtek HD Audio Manager" so I'm not quite sure what it is or who makes
  it.
</p>

<p>
  The in-built speakers are surprisingly not terrible. Granted, they are
  still laptop speakers, and compared to anything else are tinny and
  dreadful, but they have a noticable depth to the sound and are very loud.
  Perfect for podcasts, Youtube, or even light music listening if you hate
  your music. The speakers are down-firing and have little slits in the
  bottom-front of the case to speak out of. The down-firing nature likely
  helps dissapate most of the hissy high-end that is usually so present in
  laptop speakers. It also means, however, that they are completely useless
  when on a lap.
</p>

<h4 id="the-lack-of-vents">The Lack of Vents</h4>

<p>
  One thing I immediately noticed was: there are no holes. No vents, no gaps,
  no grills&hellip; The low-power nature of the CPU is such that it does
  absolutely fine with no active cooling. The lack of vents, to Steve Jobs'
  credit, very much adds to the sexiness of the design.
</p>

<p><a name="performance"></a></p>

<h3 id="performance">Performance</h3>

<p>"But Alex&hellip;" you cry, "how does it <em>perform</em>?!"</p>

<p>Firstly, a quick rundown of the guts.</p>

<ul>
  <li>Quad-core Intel Atom Z3735F (Bay-Trail) @ 1.33Ghz</li>
  <li>2GB DDR3 RAM @ 666Mhz</li>
  <li>32GB internal SD-based storage (21GB useable)</li>
  <li>Some Broadcom Wireless N card</li>
  <li>2 USB3 ports</li>
  <li>1 micro-HDMI port</li>
  <li>1 micro-SD card slot</li>
  <li>1 headphone/mic combo jack</li>
</ul>

<figure>
  <img src="cpuid.png" alt="CPU ID">
</figure>

<p>"But Alex&hellip;" you cry, "those specs are <em>shit</em>!"</p>

<p>
  They are definitely not the most impressive specs, but that was one of the
  reasons I bought this machine in the first place: I wanted to torture a Bay
  Trail chip to see what the performance was like. <a href="http://ark.intel.com/products/80274/Intel-Atom-Processor-Z3735F-2M-Cache-up-to-1_83-GHz?q=z3735f">Intel ARK reports this chip</a>
  to have a SDP of just over 2W, so just being able to <em>boot Windows</em> would be
  good enough for me to call it a successful part.
</p>

<p>Luckily, it does much more than that.</p>

<h4 id="minecraft">Minecraft</h4>

<p>
  Just for fun, I decided to play a video game. I installed Minecraft,
  generated a new world, and played for a few minutes. On average, I went
  between 15 and 22fps. A <em>lot</em> more than I was expecting. I would
  nearly call that playable, if you were in a pinch and <em>super</em> bored
  and just <em>needed</em> to play <em>something</em> no matter what.
</p>

<p>
  You won't be running Crysis on this any time soon, but hey for a light,
  casual game when you have nothing else, this works enough.
</p>

<h4 id="the-cpu">The CPU</h4>

<p>
  The Bay Trail Atom performs pretty well, but it definitely doesn't break
  any speed records.
</p>

<p>
  <a href="http://browser.primatelabs.com/geekbench3/1269677">GeekBench 3
  scores</a> a 702 and 2147 for single- and multi-core, respectively.
  It's quite obvious that this chip is a serious multi-tasker, which likely
  helps when running a full OS that generally has a tonne of background
  services and applications running.
</p>

<h4 id="the-storage">The Storage</h4>

<p>
  Interestingly, it appears this laptop uses SD-based internal storage (yes,
  <strong>SD</strong>)&hellip; Inside, as the primary storage and OS drive, is a
  Hynix (Hitachi) 32GB SD card (is it really still a card if it's permanently
  internal?).
</p>

<p>
  Also interesting is the fact is comes out-of-the-box with Bitlocker enabled. I
  hope this becomes standard for all computers.
</p>

<p>
  The performance is about what I'd expect from an SD card. Sequential read is
  pretty good, matching a high-end spinning disk, but everything else is pretty
  mediocre, even dropping to a little over 10MiB/s for random 4k writes&hellip;
</p>

<figure>
  <img src="disk.png" alt="Disk performance benchmark">
</figure>

<p>
  32GB is pretty small, especially for a full Windows laptop – honestly I'm
  surprised Windows fits on here at all… Never has an 8GB recovery partition
  seemed so large&hellip;
</p>

<h4 id="general-use">General Use</h4>

<p>
  I committed to doing everything for an entire day on this machine – including
  taking it into the office and actually doing real work. I never noticed any
  noticable slowdowns or stuttering during use, even when I had a few Chrome tabs
  open with streaming music and a couple heavy webapps like Slack.
</p>

<p>Throughout the day, I did quite a few things:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Streaming 1080p Youtube videos</li>
  <li>Streaming Google Play Music while working through SSH with two Gmail tabs and
Slack open</li>
  <li>Played Minecraft</li>
  <li>Ordered pizza online</li>
  <li>Wrote this review</li>
</ul>

<p>And not only that, but I did it all on battery.</p>

<h4 id="the-battery">The Battery</h4>

<p>
  The battery life of this laptop is by far one of the most appealing features.  I
  unplugged it when I left for work at 07:30, and didn't plug it back in until I
  got home around 17:00, still with just under 40% battery life remaining. 40%
  battery remaining after a full day of active SSH sessions, heavy browser usage,
  and near-constant screen-on time.
</p>

<p>
  The insane power-sipping tendencies of the Atom make battery life a completely
  non-issue, getting into Macbook territory – in fact, if Asus's marketing is
  correct (and all signs point to "yes"), this laptop has a 12-hour battery life,
  which matches that of the 2014 13" Macbook Air, and is <em>greater</em> than that of
  the 2014 11" Macbook Air. Granted, the performance is not at par, but it is a
  huge step up from the usual three hours your average PC laptop will achieve.
</p>

<p><a name="software"></a></p>

<h3 id="the-software">The Software</h3>

<p>
  Out-of-the-box, we get Windows 8.1 "with Bing" (I'm still not sure what
  differentiates it from regular Windows 8.1). It's everything you love (and
  probably don't love) about Windows, plus… hold on… it must be here
  somewhere&hellip;
</p>

<h4 id="bloatware">Bloatware</h4>

<p>
  Perhaps the most surprising thing about this laptop is the <em>lack</em> of
  bloatware.  There are three Asus-branded apps, all of which I never noticed
  until I looked in the "Programs and Features" control panel because they
  all do something to make the experience better, like multitouch gestures on
  the trackpad or colour correction for the display&hellip;
</p>

<p>
  Aside from all the bullshit Metro apps that come with even the OEM versions
  of Windows, there was no bloatware, adware, or trials. It was
  astonishing–and refreshing–to find.
</p>

<p>
  Suffice it to say, the "Microsoft Signature Edition" laptops definitely
  have my vote, especially for computers with 32-bit EFIs&hellip;
</p>

<h4 id="bit-efi">32-Bit EFI</h4>

<p>
  Here comes the biggest kicker of them all: the laptop ships with a
  <strong>32-bit version</strong> of Windows. Yes, 32-bit. The Atom itself is
  a 64-bit CPU, but both Windows and the UEFI are 32-bit. From what I've read
  on it, it's a memory/space-saving measure to get the most out of the measly
  2GB RAM, but still something to note.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>But there's a larger problem</strong>: Linux support for 32-bit
  UEFI is, well, nonexistent. I found a couple unofficial Debian ISOs from
  2012, but nothing else. There are many forum threads about it, and it seems
  to be a common problem amoung these low-power Atom CPUs.
</p>

<p>
  I tried for a couple hours to just <em>boot</em> a live USB, but to no
  avail. I simply could not get Linux to boot properly under a 32-bit EFI.
  I'm hoping with the proliferation of more of these small Atom machines and
  tablets that more attention is given to GRUB and related projects such that
  in the future the support will be there (or maybe a firmware patch from
  Asus to enable 64-bit booting, imagine that)&hellip;
</p>

<p>
  It's also worth mentioning that there is no legacy BIOS support, meaning
  even if you wanted to run a 32-bit Linux distro, you <em>still</em>
  couldn't boot it because the 32-bit distros use the legacy BIOS due to the
  32-bit EFI support problems.
</p>

<p>
  This is by far the killer for the machine. I originally bought it with the
  intention of installing Linux and this bizarre limitation has struck that
  down, at least for the time being.
</p>

<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>

<p>
  With power like this at a price like this, and now with everything moving
  to be internet-based services, I can see a resurgence in the "netbook"
  computer market. The performance of the Bay Trail chip has me very
  impressed, and I can't wait to work this computer into my day-to-day
  workflow.
</p>

<p>
  For me, I just wanted a simple, cheap, portable secondary laptop to take
  with me places instead of my beast of a Thinkpad. This computer fits that
  use-case <em>perfectly</em>. It has surpassed my expectations for a \$170
  netbook.
</p>

<p>
  I could recommend this laptop to students, or even business-people. If all you
  need is a super-portable machine to do email and some office-type work, this
  thing is perfect. Or if you have a powerful desktop at home and a VPN, you could
  use this as your remote machine and just work over SSH with tmux (as I do).
</p>

<p>
  Or, hell, just as a fun play machine because it's \$170.
</p>
