<p>
	When you think of <code>bash</code>, you may not consider it suitable for
	building websites. For the most part, you are probably correct. But I
	wanted to try anyway. I don't buy into most trends in the frontend web
	development community, so literally none of the "modern" static site
	generators appeal to me. All of them feel overcomplicated, too niche, or
	too javascript-y for my needs, which involve <em>just rendering a
	website</em>.
</p>

<p>
	Inspired by
	<a href="https://www.johnhawthorn.com/2018/01/this-website-is-a-makefile/">John Hawthorn's makefile website workflow</a>,
	I decided that was almost exactly what I wanted. However, I didn't really
	want to depend on anything outside of standard unix tools (so no Ruby).
	This is where bash comes in.
</p>

<h2>"uhhh"</h2>

<p>
	Look, hear me out. There are some reasons I actually ended up liking this:
</p>

<ul>
	<li>All the normal benefits of building static sites</li>
	<li>Really fast (sub-second full site builds on my laptop)</li>
	<li>No dependencies outside of GNU/POSIX tools</li>
	<li>It's kind of fun and weird</li>
	<li>i don't need to install 2500 npm packages and learn a cool new templating language that will be obsolete and unmaintained in 4 months</li>
</ul>

<p>
	Ultimately, this was just a fun project to make my personal site a little
	more interesting. This really isn't something that is overly practical.
	Nothing wrong with a little fun now and then, though!
</p>

<h2>The result</h2>

<p>
	Before we get in the weeds, let's see what the end-goal for project
	structure is. I've removed a few things that are in my own site, just to
	keep this example simple.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">$ tree -F --dirsfirst</div>
<pre><code>.
├── _build/
│   └── ...
├── bin/
│   └── render*
├── layouts/
│   └── site.html
├── pages/
│   ├── some-page/

├── static/
│   ├── _/
│   │   └── site.css
│   └── favicon.ico
├── Makefile
└── helpers.sh</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	Basically, we have a directory for pages (<code>./pages</code>) and then one directory for each page, with a <code>.meta</code> file for metadata (title, variables, etc) and a <code>.html</code> file for the content itself.
</p>

<h2>Setting up <code>make</code></h2>

<p>
	Originally, I had started with pure bash -- just a single bash script that
	handled the entire pipeline from finding the files, to parsing them, to
	writing to a file. This actually worked out great, but was missing some
	niceties like incremental builds, and meant a lot of it was sort of
	"intertwined" where rendering a page had weird knowledge about where that
	page should be written to disk.
</p>

<p>
	So ultimately I decided simplifying the shell script to just render a page
	to <code>stdout</code> and let good ol&rsquo; <code>make</code> handle the
	reading and writing seemed like a more robust option.
</p>

<p>
	Luckily, because we're just running one command and writing that to disk,
	our Makefile can be pretty simple:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">Makefile</div>
<pre><code><span class="code-dim"># Find all html and meta files in the pages directory</span>
pageSources=\$(shell find pages -type f -name '*.html' -o -name '*.meta')

<span class="code-dim"># Map all the html files in the list of sources to the target path in _build</span>
pageTargets=\$(pageSources:pages/%.html=_build/%.html)

all: \$(pageTargets)

_build/%.html: pages/%.html pages/%.meta
	<span class="code-dim"># Silently (@) make all directories leading up to our target file (\$@)</span>
	@mkdir -p \$(dir \$@)

	<span class="code-dim"># Run our render script, giving the source file name (\$&lt;), substring-
	# replacing "html" with "meta" (as our script expects to be given
	# the meta file). Write the output to the target filename (\$@)</span>
	bin/render \$(&lt;:html=meta) &gt; \$@

clean:
	rm -rf _build/*</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	All this does is find all <code>*.meta</code> and <code>*.html</code>
	files, and tell <code>make</code> that those should turn into a single HTML
	file in <code>_build</code>, by running the <code>bin/render</code> script.
	Of course, a lot of this is terse or a bit weird to read if you're
	unfamiliar with Makefiles, but in the end it is rather simple, and provides
	some pretty significant power for not a lot of code.
</p>

<h2>Proof of concept: straight renders</h2>

<p>
	To prove that this might actually work, the first thing to get going is a
	just rendering the page HTML itself, with basic variable substitution for
	things like page title, etc., but without a layout or any fancy stuff.
</p>

<p>
	The general idea here is to parse our template files inside a Here
	Document, which will give them full access to shell functions, local
	variables, and any command they want, really. This is obviously a huge
	security risk, but there should never be untrusted code being executed in
	this context, so the realistic risk is pretty minimal.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">bin/render</div>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euf -o pipefail

render() {
	title="My web page"
	\$(eval "cat &lt;&lt;EOF
		\$(&lt;pages/\$1.html)
EOF")
}

render \$@ </code></pre></div>

<p>
	In essence, what we're doing here is reading an HTML file in as a string,
	which is interpolated into a heredoc, which is piped into <code>cat</code>,
	which is in a string, which we are evaluating as if it were a script
	itself. This means that the normal variable scope and expansion applies to
	our template.
</p>

<p>
	The <code>index.html</code> source file, for reference:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">pages/index.html</div>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;\$title&lt;/h1&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	And that's honestly about it. Everything else from here is just doing this
	multiple times, or adding some sugar or abstractions. Speaking of, let's
	make this nicer.
</p>

<h2>Adding a layout</h2>

<p>
	Currently we're just copying one file around, which isn't really helpful
	for a static site builder! What really made this "click" was getting a
	layout template wrapping the pages -- the most basic feature of any static
	site generator.
</p>

<p>
	So let's do that. All this is really doing is assigning the page to a
	variable, then rendering the layout as if it was the page.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">bin/render</div>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euf -o pipefail

render() {
	title="My web page"
<span class="code-rem">	\$(eval "cat &lt;&lt;EOF</span>
<span class="code-add">	content=\$(eval "cat &lt;&lt;EOF</span>
		\$(&lt;pages/\$1.html)
EOF")

<span class="code-add">	\$(eval "cat &lt;&lt;-EOF</span>
<span class="code-add">		\$(&lt;layouts/site.html)</span>
<span class="code-add">	EOF")</span>
}

render \$@
</code></pre></div>

<p>
	In our layout, we can then just use <code>\$content</code> where we want to
	render the page content.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">layouts/site.html</div>
<pre><code>&lt;!doctype html&gt;
&lt;title&gt;\$title&lt;/title&gt;
<span class="code-hl">\$content</span></code></pre>

<p>
	We're getting pretty close to something useful. But hard-coding all our
	metadata in the build script doesn't scale. Let's fix that.
</p>


<h2>Metadata is just scripts</h2>

<p>
	Previously I had mentioned <code>.meta</code> files, but up until now we
	haven't used them.  Since our pages are being rendered within the context
	of the bash script, we can source other scripts in dynamically. So, our
	<code>.meta</code> files are just little bash scripts that are evaluated
	right before render. Thus, they could contain variables, functions, calls
	to external APIs or programs&hellip;
</p>

<p>
	Here's the <code>.meta</code> file for our page:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">page/index.meta</div>
<pre><code>title="My web page"
lastUpdatedAt="2019-06-13"</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	And in the build script, all we need to do is source our <code>.meta</code>
	file dynamically, as we do with the HTML template.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">bin/render</div>
<pre><code>&hellip;
render() {
<span class="code-rem">	title="My web page"</span>
<span class="code-add">	. "pages/\$1.meta"</span>
	content=\$(eval "cat &lt;&lt;EOF
		\$(&lt;pages/\$1.html)
EOF")
&hellip;</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	Another "lightbulb" moment is when you start to add shell functions. Want
	to format a date? Good news! Basically every computer probably already has
	<code>date(1)</code>.
</p>

<p>
	We can just add more functions to the <code>bin/render</code> file, or if
	we have a lot we can source a second file into it... It's just a shell
	script, so I mean you can do whatever you want.
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">bin/render</div>
<pre><code>#!/usr/bin/env bash

set -euf -o pipefail

<span class="code-add">formatDate() {</span>
<span class="code-add">	echo \$(date -d "\$1" +"%B %-d %Y")</span>
<span class="code-add">}</span>

render() {
&hellip;</code></pre>
</div>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">pages/index.html</div>
<pre><code>&lt;h1&gt;\$title&lt;/h1&gt;
Last updated: \$(formatDate \$lastUpdatedAt)</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	That's it. Now we can use ISO-8601 dates in our metadata, but still display
	"human" dates on the site itself.
</p>

<p>
	You can even combine it with Here Documents to make more complex render
	helper functions. I do this on my site to dynamically discover blog
	articles from the filesystem, parse and sort them based on their date in
	metadata, and then render a provided template string with the new local
	variables. It's a bit convoluted and gross to use as a direct example, so
	here's a simplified one:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">build.sh</div>
<pre><code>&hellip;

renderItems() {
	items=(one two three)
	template="\$(while read template ; do echo \$template ; done)"

	for item in \${items[*]} ; do
		eval "cat &lt;&lt;-EOFOR
			\$template
		EOFOR"
	done
}

&hellip;</code></pre>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">pages/index.html</div>
<pre><code>&hellip;

&lt;ul&gt;
\$(renderItems &lt;&lt;-EOTEMPLATE
	&lt;li&gt;\$item&lt;/li&gt;
EOTEMPLATE)
&lt;/ul&gt;</code></pre>
</div>

<p>
	At this point, that's basically 90% of a static site generator. You got
	layouts, templates, and metadata variables with support for helper
	functions, extenal "plugins" (normal CLI tools)&hellip; What more do you
	need?
</p>

<h2>Assets</h2>

<p>
	Every site will have some CSS, JS, images, and whatever else. You could
	call out to some preprocessor or crazy thing if you really wanted, but for
	me I am happy with raw CSS and JS, so here is my asset pipeline:
</p>

<div class="code">
	<div class="code-title">Makefile</div>
<pre><code>pageSources=\$(shell find pages -type f -name '*.html' -o -name '*.meta')
pageTargets=\$(pageSources:pages/%.html=_build/%.html)

<span class="code-add">staticSources=\$(shell find static -type f)</span>
<span class="code-add">staticTargets=\$(staticSources:static/%=_build/%)</span>

<span class="code-rem">all: \$(pageTargets)</span>
<span class="code-add">all: \$(pageTargets) \$(staticTargets)</span>

&hellip;

<span class="code-add">_build/%: static/%</span>
<span class="code-add">	@mkdir -p \$(dir \$@)</span>
<span class="code-add">	cp \$< \$@</span>

&hellip;
</code></pre>

<p>
	🖌👌✨
</p>

<h2>What's the catch?</h2>

<p>
	While the core idea proved to work out great, it was not without rough
	edges. In the end, these all proved fine to work around or put up with, but
	they exist nonetheless.
</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Escaping normal content</strong> &mdash; since every page is parsed as a string, you need to be careful what that string contains. For example, "<code>I paid \$50</code>" needs to be "<code>I paid \\\$50</code>" to avoid <code>\$5</code> being parsed as a variable.</li>
		<li><strong>Shell scripts kind of suck</strong> &mdash; shell scripting is not really a pleasant environment. Decades of weird decisions, cumbersome syntax... While shell scripts get you a powerful and highly extensible environment, that comes at a cost of some readability and "niceness" that you might expect from something like ERB or Handlebars, for example.</li>
		<li><strong>Cross-OS compatibility is a nightmare</strong> &mdash; you'd think POSIX meant everything behaves the same but HA-HA NOPE good luck maintaining weird <code>if</code> statements to try and make sure you pass different flags to GNU vs. BSD <code>date</code> or <code>find</code> to support both platforms.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Also I left out a bunch of other stuff</h2>

<p>
	I have left out a significant amount of work and numerous features that are
	implemented in the "real" version of this script that powers my site. You
	are free to
	<a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/watashi">peruse my website's source code</a>,
	if you are curious. This post was intended not to be a guide or tutorial
	but just a neat showcase of a semi-crazy idea.
</p>

<p>
	In brief, some features that were pretty easy to add that my script ended
	up supporting:

	<ul>
		<li>custom layouts per page</li>
		<li>nested layouts for articles</li>
		<li>xml pages and layouts (rss feed)</li>
		<li>dynamically building list of articles from filesystem</li>
	</ul>
</p>

<p>
	This was a fun project for me, and the end result solved a real need.
	Hopefully it was as interesting to you as it was me!
