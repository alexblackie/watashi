This is the source for my website, [[https://www.alexblackie.com][alexblackie.com]].

** Building

This site is constructed using a bespoke series of shell scripts (bash, sorry)
that parse and assemble all the content and pages.

There are no unusual dependencies. If you have the GNU coreutils, or a BSD
userland, you have everything you need. The major players here are =make=,
=bash=, =find=, and =cat=.

To compile the site:

#+BEGIN_SRC bash
make
#+END_SRC

The files will be placed in =./_build=.

To watch for changes, combine this with a tool such as [[http://eradman.com/entrproject/][entr]]:

#+BEGIN_SRC <bash>
ag -l | entr -cr make
#+END_SRC
