	<strong>Update 2018-07</strong>: As of July 2018 DigitalOcean <a href="https://www.digitalocean.com/docs/release-notes/2018/private-networking/">has begun rolling out</a> true private networking that is isolated per-account. This is a great step forward, and I sincerely hope other VPS providers follow suit. Until then, this post is still relevant for basically every other provider.
</p>

<p>
  A while ago I deployed a blog using DigitalOcean's infrastructure. I used
  separate droplets for the database and web tier, and used the "private IP"
  feature to only allow MySQL traffic over that interface. I noticed the
  private network seemed larger than necessary for just hosting my own stuff,
  so I did a little digging.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>DigitalOcean's "private networking" is quite literally the opposite
  of private.</strong> Your droplet's private IP will be in a shared subnet
  with every other customer's if they end up on the same network as you. Do not
  think for a minute you can "trust the LAN" or anything like that; I'm sure if
  I scanned deeper I could find dozens of unauthenticated Redis and database
  servers people inadvertently have opened to this not-so-private network.
</p>

<p>
  <strong>Unfortunately, this isn't just DigitalOcean's problem.</strong> I
  ran a couple tests from one of my instances on Linode and was shocked to find
  their Private IP feature both assigns the address to the same interface as
  the public IP, and shares the subnet with many other customers.  These are
  just the two providers I have used; I would hazard to guess this is a common
  practice among the smaller non-Openstack cloud providers.
</p>

<p>
  To demonstrate this issue, I spun up a droplet in DigitalOcean's TOR-1
  region. The private interface has the entire <code>10.137.0.0/16</code>
  network routed, and I decided to try doing a basic scan to enumerate the
  entire subnet.
</p>

<div class="code">
  <div class="code-title">nmap -sn 10.137.0.0/16</div>
<pre><code>Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2018-03-03 17:06 UTC

</code></pre></div>

<p>
  I have exactly one other droplet in that region, and yet my brand new droplet
  can access <em>over five thousand</em> other customers' servers on a
  supposedly "private" network. This is not only misleading, but the messaging
  makes it sound like you can trust it; I don't even want to try and knock on
  ports to see how many open-to-the-world services are running.
</p>

<p>
  I won't pretend to be all-knowing and condescending: nothing about running
  infrastructure is easy. However, having separate networks per customer would
  make dramatic improvements to the service's scalability and security, and at
  the very least having one VXLAN per customer seems like a painfully obvious
  good practice.
</p>

<p>
  To verify this, I spun up a droplet in two completely separate DigitalOcean
  accounts (I added my personal CC to my work account to test this).
</p>

<p>
  Right off-the-bat I was able to confirm that both droplets had private IP
  addresses in the same subnet range. Then, on one droplet I started <code>nc
  -l 64321</code>, and on the second I tried to <code>nmap</code> the private
  IP of my second droplet. I was successful.
</p>

<div class="code">
  <div class="code-title">nmap -sS -p64321 10.132.146.7</div>
<pre><code>Starting Nmap 6.40 ( http://nmap.org ) at 2018-03-03 21:57 UTC

</pre></code>
</div>

<p>
  And here's an obligatory screenshot. The left-side droplet is running under
  my personal account, the right-side droplet is under a completely different
  account (but the droplets are in the same region).

  </a>
</figure>

<p>
  Luckily my further attempts to <code>tcpdump</code> the traffic between the
  two hosts were unsuccessful. But one could still do a fair amount of damage
  if someone entrusted a service like Redis or NFS to allow connections from
  the entire network of the private interface.

  I take great issue with these features being labelled "Private Networking" as
  there is nothing private about them whatsoever. There's nothing stopping me
  from spinning up a new server in the same region as you and suddenly I am on
  the same "private" network as you.
</p>

<p>
  By calling this feature "private", it implies privacy. This may mislead
  people into setting up unsecured services because they assume the network
  they are exposing them on is only for their consumption. As long as "hostile
  LAN" practices are followed, having a public private network should be
  <em>fine</em>, but I would strongly urge these cloud providers to implement
  at the very least customer isolation, if not full OpenStack-style SDN.
</p>

<p>
  I hope this post serves as a warning to anyone running services on the
  "underdog" cloud providers: your private network is absolutely not private,
  and you may have an unforseen attack vector left wide open.
