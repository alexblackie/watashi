<p>I checked my Facebook today, and noticed in the sidebar where it usually bullies me to enter my email login to find more people, it said &#8220;Windows Live&#8221; and had pre-filled my hotmail address that I don&#8217;t use for anything. This scared me.</p>

<p>My first question was: &#8220;<em>How did Facebook know I have a hotmail address?</em>&#8220;. I only use the hotmail address for SkyDrive and Office Online, and nothing else. I had never had it as my Facebook email, and have never told anyone about it.</p>

<p>And then I figured it out.</p>

<p>I had signed into Windows Live today to get something, and didn&#8217;t sign out. Turns out, Facebook was mining my cookies, found hotmail, and stole that information to market one of their stupid products to me.</p>

<p>That&#8217;s the last straw.</p>

<p><s>From now on, I will only use Facebook through a different browser that I use for nothing other than Facebook.</s> <strong>I am quitting Facebook. I will no longer use it. It is evil.</strong> This way I will have no personal information for them to steal from me behind my back without asking.</p>

<p>Facebook, this little event has made me lose the tiny bit of compassion I have for you. You and me are now on bad terms.</p>
