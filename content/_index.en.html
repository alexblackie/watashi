		<p>
			I&rsquo;ve been doing software development professionally since 2009. In that time, I&rsquo;ve worked for
			<a href="https://www.shopify.ca">Shopify</a> (Developer, Payments Platform) and
			<a href="https://www.wealthsimple.com">Wealthsimple</a> (Senior Software Engineer, Platform Security),
			as well as few small agencies and startups. My first real job was working over the summers at
			<a href="https://www.metalab.com">Metalab</a> during my high school years.
		</p>
		<p>
			My technical experience spans high-performance backend APIs, cloud infrastructure and "DevOps", datacentre
			network architecture, security blue-teaming, and even frontend JS. In recent years, I've pivoted into an
			entrepreneurial path, co-founding Linear Forest (a custom software consultancy), and BlackieOps (a cybersecurity and
			infrastructure company).
