This is the application that runs [alexblackie dot com](https://www.alexblackie.com).

This is a Ruby application, built using a couple pieces from the wonderful
[Hanami](https://github.com/hanami) framework, with some custom glue.

## Development

Ensure you have the latest Ruby and Bundler.

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec shotgun
```

The app will start on `[::1]:9393`.

## Testing

There is an RSpec test suite that you should always run.

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```
