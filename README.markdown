This is the source for my website, [alexblackie.com][0].

## Building

This site is constructed using a bespoke series of shell scripts (bash, sorry)
that parse and assemble all the content and pages.

The only dependencies are the GNU coreutils (`make`, `find`, `cat`, `bash`) and
Python's `pygmentize` CLI (usually available as `python-pygments` on Linuxes).

To compile the site:

```bash
$ make
```

The files will be placed in `./_build`.

To watch for changes, combine this with a tool such as [entr][1]:

```bash
$ ag -l | entr -cr make
```
