This is the application that runs [alexblackie dot com](https://www.alexblackie.com).

## Development

This is a Ruby application, using my own web framework,
[Yokunai](https://github.com/alexblackie/yokunai). Ensure you have the latest
Ruby and Bundler.

```
$ bundle
$ bundle exec rackup

The app will start on `[::1]:9292`.

## Testing

There is an RSpec test suite that you should always run.

```
$ bundle exec rspec
```
