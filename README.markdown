This is the source for my website, [alexblackie.com][0].

## Building

This site is constructed using a bespoke series of shell scripts (bash, sorry)
that parse and assemble all the content and pages.

The only dependencies are the GNU coreutils (`make`, `find`, `cat`, `bash`) and
Python's `pygmentize` CLI (usually available as `python-pygments` on Linuxes).

To compile the site:

```bash
$ make
```

The files will be placed in `./_build`.

To watch for changes, combine this with a tool such as [entr][1]:

```bash
$ ag -l | entr -cr make
```

### Building on macOS

As mentioned, these scripts exclusively support the GNU coreutils tools. If you
are on a non-GNU operation system such as macOS, a development-focused
Dockerfile is provided as an easy way to get a compatible environment quickly.

```
$ docker build -f Dockerfile.dev -t watashi-dev .
$ docker run -it --rm -v `pwd`:/data -p 3000:3000 watashi-dev
```

This will start both a web server (on port 3000), and a file watcher to
recompile changes automatically.
