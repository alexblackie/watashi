            I'm always trying to find ways to improve my workstation. I love
            reading about and looking at other people's desks and workspaces,
            taking inspiration wherever I can. Hopefully this breakdown of my
            own helps others in the same way.

			<h2>Hardware</h2>

			<p>
				My "daily driver" computer is the <mark>Macbook Pro 14"</mark>
				(2021, M1 Max, 64GB RAM, 1TB SSD). This machine lured me from
				my Linux roots and is definitely the best laptop I've ever
				owned.
			</p>

			<p>
				When at my desk, I have two <mark>Dell U2520D</mark> 25" 1440p
				displays. These are about 120dpi, which is high enough density
				to not look terrible, but still is large enough to not require
				software scaling. That, plus the colour accuracy and
				professional aesthetic makes them some of my favourite displays
				to date.
			</p>

			<p>
				For input, I use a <mark>ZSA Moonlander</mark> with
				after-market <mark>ZealPC Tealios</mark> switches. The typing
				experience on a split ortholinear keyboard is incredibly
				comfortable, and the Tealios make for insanely smooth key
				presses.
			</p>

			<p>
				For pointing, I use an <mark>Apple Magic Trackpad 2</mark>.
				Whenever I have used Macs, I have loved using Apple's wireless
				trackpads, going back to the first one in 2010. I do also have
				an original <mark>Logitech MX Master</mark> which I keep around
				mostly for games.
			</p>

			<p>
				For music listening, I have an <mark>Audient iD4</mark> audio
				interface and a pair of <mark>Beyerdynamic DT-770 Pros</mark>
				(the 250&ohm; variant). Additionally, I have a pair of
				<mark>Airpods Pro</mark> (2nd generation) which I use for
				listening to stuff around or out of the house.
			</p>

			<p>
				For meetings, screencasts, podcasts, or any other voice-related
				activity I have a <mark>Shure SM7B</mark> connected to the same
				Audient interface, albeit amplified by a <mark>Cloudlifter CL-1</mark>
				to get a bit more gain headroom. It's shock-mounted to a
				generic Blue microphone arm.
			</p>

			<p>
				Everything on my desk is connected through a <mark>Caldigit TS3+</mark>
				Thunderbolt dock. The laptop itself is tucked behind the
				displays, held vertically by a <mark>Twelvesouth BookArc</mark>
				stand.

				<h2>Software</h2>

				<p>
					Probably the best resource for the details on my software
					setup is <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/dotfiles">my dotfiles</a>
					and <a href="https://github.com/alexblackie/setup">the Ansible playbooks</a>
					that set up all my machines.
				</p>

				<p>
					For getting work done, I primarily use <mark>Firefox</mark>
					for web-based things, <mark>neovim</mark> for text editing,
					<mark>kitty</mark> for terminal emulation,
					<mark>Obsidian</mark> for note-taking, and
					<mark>Todoist</mark> for managing my life with lists. My
					development environments live in headless <mark>UTM</mark>
					VMs, usually running either Fedora or Debian Sid.
				</p>

				<p>
					I maintain my own music library which I host with
					with <mark>Plex</mark>, and access with
					<mark>Plexamp</mark> on macOS and <mark>Prism</mark> on
					iOS. The experience is better than any streaming service, I
					get to keep my obscure music, and can directly support
					artists by buying their albums.
				</p>

				<p>
					Cloud infrastructure is a mix of <mark>Microsoft Azure</mark>,
					<mark>Linode</mark>, and <mark>OVH</mark>. Cloud resources
					are automated with <mark>Terraform</mark>, and
					non-Kubernetes servers are configured using
					<mark>Ansible</mark> playbooks.
				</p>

				<p>
					For myself and my family I run or manage a few services,
					including <mark>Nextcloud</mark> for file syncing and
					storage, <mark>Fastmail</mark> for email and workgroups,
					<mark>Tailscale</mark> for a mesh VPN and secure traffic
					tunneling, and <mark>Azure AD</mark> for secure
					identity management and SSO.
				</p>

				<h2>Furniture</h2>

				<p>
					My desk is a near-death <mark>Ikea Bekant</mark> motorised
					sit/stand model. It barely survived moving across the
					country and is literally falling apart. It's still sturdy
					enough for now, and gets the job done.
				</p>

				<p>
					For sitting, I have a "fully loaded" <mark>Herman Miller Mirra 2</mark>
					chair. It is incredibly comfortable, perhaps <em>too</em>
					comfortable as I often forget to stand during the day.
